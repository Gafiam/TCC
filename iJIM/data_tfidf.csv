48,Supporting Factors for the Implementation of Mobile Learning for Elementary School Students Using an Authentic Approach and Real-World Activities,"The aim of this research is to determine the supporting factors for the implementation of mobile learning for elementary school students in Indonesia using an authentic approach and real-world activities. This is significant because various approaches to mobile learning have been used in elementary institutions. However, this educational model is not ideal because the data shows that 92% of students have learning difficulties, and 38% state they do not receive teachers guidance.The method used was descriptive quantitative with the population of elementary school students and a purposively selected sample of 26 of those pupils. Samples were taken based on the characteristics of the coastal area and city center. To assess their entry behavior, questionnaires and test sheets were used. Moreover, data was gathered through home visits and the Whatsapp application. It was then processed using the percentage technique and the SmartPLS application, to obtain accurate results. In addition, a qualitative approach was used to develop the analysis.According to the results, the supporting factors for the implementation of mobile learning using an authentic approach and real-world activities are as follows: 1) students already have the concrete and logical thinking skills, 2) the entry behavior of students are still low, and 3) visual and auditory learning styles affect meaningful learning. Furthermore, research suggests that teachers and learning designers should create mobile learning exercises which support authentic learning and real-world pursuits. ,"

77,"Solving Technological, Pedagogical, and Psychological Problems in Mobile Learning","This paper aims to explore the various problems associated with the technological, pedagogical, and psychological aspects of mobile learning and develop recommendations for its improvement.  Mobile learning becomes increasingly popular today. This type of learning is relatively new. It has recently gained popularity due to the pandemic restrictions in 2020. As mobile learning is being actively used, educators, students, and other professionals begin to note its positive and negative sides.  The study is based on the method of experiment as well as an online 11-item questionnaire was conducted (developed by authors) with 110 teachers in Russian universities (Russian State University named by A.N. Kosygina, I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, and Kuban State Technological University).  The practical significance and prospects for further research are based on the possibility of using the results in further study of the problem of the impact of mobile applications on specific indicators.  It was found that, given the great prevalence of mobile devices today, there is every reason to implement mobile learning at universities. However, there are infrastructural problems that prevent the widespread use of this mode of delivery (problems with the Internet, old gadgets that do not support 4G, lack of technical support, etc.). Teachers also mention a set of problems associated with the quality of such training, which are mainly related to pedagogical and psychological aspects of the process. About 56% of university teachers say that students often behave irresponsibly during online classes. They are inattentive, tend to skip lessons, and do not hand in the tasks, which leads to a decline of knowledge and failing at tests and exams. Around 68% of teachers have difficulties adapting their teaching methods to a mobile learning environment.   This study proposes structured recommendations to improve the quality of mobile learning by advancing technology skills, adapting mobile learning to the needs of universities, and raising the motivation of teachers and students.  The results of the study can be used to analyze and compare the impact of mobile learning on society, efficiency in various fields, as well as mobile learning of students on future employment and life in society.In the future it will be important to conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of mobile learning on students and teachers, to study the effectiveness of such learning in general.,"
93,Factors Influencing the Acceptance of Mobile Learning in K-12 Education in Saudi Arabia: Towards a Shift in the Saudi Education System vis-à-vis Saudi 2030 Vision,"The Saudi Arabian government is committed to updating and improving its education system. Thus, in March 2017, a project was declared to convert the existing book-based methodology to modern, mobile technology in the K-12 education space by 2021. As part of this process, a deep-dive literature review of student acceptance of mobile learning confirmed that there was limited research into what elements had an effect on how much students were likely to accept learning with mobile applications in the five to 18-year-old demographic of K-12. The conclusion of the literature review was that the Saudi Arabian Education Ministry must acquire an understanding of these elements in order to strategize the implementation of the new technology. This study approached high school students, aged 16 – 18, in Saudi Arabia, to examine the elements which would influence their acceptance of mobile learning technology. The research consolidated known elements of education, namely learning self-management, system quality, and hedonic motivation with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to create a significant theoretical model for the new technology in a high school setting. Conclusions were drawn that societal influence did not affect the students approach to mobile learning, but that learning self-management, the expectancy of effort and performance, hedonic motivation and the quality of the system did affect the acceptance behaviour of the students. It was also noted that gender was not a significant factor in the study"

67,A Novel Scheme for Malicious Nodes Detection in Cloud Markets Based on Fuzzy Logic Technique,"Cloud security vulnerabilities have recently become more prevalent around the world, posing a threat to cloud service providers' (CSPs) ability to respond to client demands. In cloud market, the requests are announced by the client nodes to their CSP. A malicious node can alter a client's request, resulting in the next cloud market collapse, decreased reliability, and data leaking.To identify malicious nodes in the cloud market, a novel fuzzy multiple criterion decision making scheme is suggested. Authentication test, trust level, traffic size, and node activity levels are all taken into consideration simultaneously as the major criteria for identifying malicious nodes. For each node, the CSP uses fuzzy Integral to generate a composite value based on these criteria. The malicious node is then removed from the cloud market using this composite value. The simulation results demonstrated the potential of the proposed method to prevent nodes in the cloud market from running malware or software that can be used to degrade quality of service by exhausting resources in the cloud market.,"

144,Building Operation and Maintenance: A Framework for Simplified Building Information Modeling (BIM) Digital Mobile Application,"Managing maintenance cost data is one of the issues due to difficulties in identifying the accurate cost for maintenance and repair of specific components. This is because of the accounting systems used by majority of building managers. The introduction of Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a tool for facilitating information and knowledge sharing through digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility has seen wide application in the construction industry, spanning over the entire life cycle of a facility, i.e., planning, design, pre-construction, construction and post-construction. In post-construction stage, BIM is used for transferring the data of building (spaces, systems and components) into maintenance management operations, keeping track of building assets, and enable scheduled maintenance and provides information of building maintenance history. However, the current BIM rather complex and requires a huge amount of data to develop, which make the system is difficult to adopt for the existing buildings. This study therefore aims to investigate the implementation of BIM for Operation and Maintenance Management (O&M) in Malaysia by identifying the information that should be prioritized to enable BIM mobile application at O&M phase. The study makes used of qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. Three (3) rounds of expert discussion using Delphi techniques were carried out with 10 to 15 selected respondents (experts in O&M and BIM). The framework validated by a case study via on-site data collection, which used site measurement, building modelling using appropriate software i.e., Revit and AutoCAD. Most of the experts agreed that technology could improve the efficiency of service delivery and interested in implementing BIM in O&M practices. Simplified BIM for O&M that consists of the critical information includes location, dimension asset information, asset capacity, specification, manufacturer, statutory, condition and cost was developed. For the O&M element and items, information varies and can be modified according to the needs. All this information was systematically organized in a data matrix.
