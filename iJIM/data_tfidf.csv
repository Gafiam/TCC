48,Supporting Factors for the Implementation of Mobile Learning for Elementary School Students Using an Authentic Approach and Real-World Activities,"The aim of this research is to determine the supporting factors for the implementation of mobile learning for elementary school students in Indonesia using an authentic approach and real-world activities. This is significant because various approaches to mobile learning have been used in elementary institutions. However, this educational model is not ideal because the data shows that 92% of students have learning difficulties, and 38% state they do not receive teachers guidance.The method used was descriptive quantitative with the population of elementary school students and a purposively selected sample of 26 of those pupils. Samples were taken based on the characteristics of the coastal area and city center. To assess their entry behavior, questionnaires and test sheets were used. Moreover, data was gathered through home visits and the Whatsapp application. It was then processed using the percentage technique and the SmartPLS application, to obtain accurate results. In addition, a qualitative approach was used to develop the analysis.According to the results, the supporting factors for the implementation of mobile learning using an authentic approach and real-world activities are as follows: 1) students already have the concrete and logical thinking skills, 2) the entry behavior of students are still low, and 3) visual and auditory learning styles affect meaningful learning. Furthermore, research suggests that teachers and learning designers should create mobile learning exercises which support authentic learning and real-world pursuits. ,"

77,"Solving Technological, Pedagogical, and Psychological Problems in Mobile Learning","This paper aims to explore the various problems associated with the technological, pedagogical, and psychological aspects of mobile learning and develop recommendations for its improvement.  Mobile learning becomes increasingly popular today. This type of learning is relatively new. It has recently gained popularity due to the pandemic restrictions in 2020. As mobile learning is being actively used, educators, students, and other professionals begin to note its positive and negative sides.  The study is based on the method of experiment as well as an online 11-item questionnaire was conducted (developed by authors) with 110 teachers in Russian universities (Russian State University named by A.N. Kosygina, I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, and Kuban State Technological University).  The practical significance and prospects for further research are based on the possibility of using the results in further study of the problem of the impact of mobile applications on specific indicators.  It was found that, given the great prevalence of mobile devices today, there is every reason to implement mobile learning at universities. However, there are infrastructural problems that prevent the widespread use of this mode of delivery (problems with the Internet, old gadgets that do not support 4G, lack of technical support, etc.). Teachers also mention a set of problems associated with the quality of such training, which are mainly related to pedagogical and psychological aspects of the process. About 56% of university teachers say that students often behave irresponsibly during online classes. They are inattentive, tend to skip lessons, and do not hand in the tasks, which leads to a decline of knowledge and failing at tests and exams. Around 68% of teachers have difficulties adapting their teaching methods to a mobile learning environment.   This study proposes structured recommendations to improve the quality of mobile learning by advancing technology skills, adapting mobile learning to the needs of universities, and raising the motivation of teachers and students.  The results of the study can be used to analyze and compare the impact of mobile learning on society, efficiency in various fields, as well as mobile learning of students on future employment and life in society.In the future it will be important to conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of mobile learning on students and teachers, to study the effectiveness of such learning in general.,"
93,Factors Influencing the Acceptance of Mobile Learning in K-12 Education in Saudi Arabia: Towards a Shift in the Saudi Education System vis-à-vis Saudi 2030 Vision,"The Saudi Arabian government is committed to updating and improving its education system. Thus, in March 2017, a project was declared to convert the existing book-based methodology to modern, mobile technology in the K-12 education space by 2021. As part of this process, a deep-dive literature review of student acceptance of mobile learning confirmed that there was limited research into what elements had an effect on how much students were likely to accept learning with mobile applications in the five to 18-year-old demographic of K-12. The conclusion of the literature review was that the Saudi Arabian Education Ministry must acquire an understanding of these elements in order to strategize the implementation of the new technology. This study approached high school students, aged 16 – 18, in Saudi Arabia, to examine the elements which would influence their acceptance of mobile learning technology. The research consolidated known elements of education, namely learning self-management, system quality, and hedonic motivation with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to create a significant theoretical model for the new technology in a high school setting. Conclusions were drawn that societal influence did not affect the students approach to mobile learning, but that learning self-management, the expectancy of effort and performance, hedonic motivation and the quality of the system did affect the acceptance behaviour of the students. It was also noted that gender was not a significant factor in the study"
95,Factors Affecting Students Desire to Take Upcoming Online Courses after E-learning Experience During Covid 19,"Since 2020, Covid 19 has completely changed the daily activities of almost all nations, and education has been heavily affected. Because of school closures, face-to-face classrooms were halted or replaced with online classes in which both lecturers and learners had to adjust their teaching and learning styles to cope with unexpected situations. The ‘new normal of learning from homes, spending hours staring at screens, and struggling with piles of online tasks has somehow demotivated students to continue learning. This study explores factors affecting students desire to take online courses after experiencing e-learning during Covid 19. Nine hundred fifty-five students of Vietnam National University took part in the survey via an online questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS20; correlation, hierarchical regression was employed to examine how online factors influence students decision. The research results showed that skill enhancement, self-regulated learning, lecturer interaction during the course were among the most important predictors of students desire to take more online courses. In contrast, student interaction imposed no significant influence. This study gives the theoretical background for other studies in the same field and suggests practical implications for governments and universities to implement online training better to cope with the pandemic...,"

The aim of the model is to potentially increase the learning effectiveness of individuals or groups by appropriately matching and allocating mobile learning materials/applications according to each learnerâ??s type. Examples are given. Our current research investigations relating to this model are described."
206,From E-Learning to M-Learning - the use of Mixed Reality Games as a new Educational Paradigm,This paper analyses different definitions of mobile learning which have been proposed by various researchers.  The most distinctive features of mobile learning are extracted to propose a new definition for Mobile Educational Mixed Reality Games (MEMRG).  A questionnaire and a quantifying scale are designed to assist the game developers in designing MEMRG.  A new psycho-pedagogical approach to teaching is proposed for MEMRG.   This methodology is based on the theme of â??conversationâ?? between different actors of the learning community with the objective of building the architectural framework for MEMRG.
216,An Analog Electronics Mobile Course with a Competitive Learning Approach,"In the last years several mobile learning courses have been experimented. The increasing popularity and additional features of mobile devices is one of the key reasons for mobile learning courses development. The superior portability and accessibility of those equipments makes them suitable for remote and interactive learning courses. In this context, this paper focuses on the implementation of a mobile learning framework for an analog electronics course. This course was designed as a complement to the classic analog electronics courses. This course consists of several interactive multimedia modules, at the end of which students have to answer several oriented questions. These give feedback about the learning process to the teacher, which receives SMS messages with the results. A specific module is responsible for storing and managing the answers in a server, where all the results from students are processed in a competitive learning based methodology application."
217,"Motivation, Psychology and Language Effect on Mobile Learning in Universiti Sains Malaysia","The aim of this study was to examine the motivation, psychology and language effect on Mobile learning in the School of Distance Education, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang. Mobile learning or m-learning is a new learning phenomenon in the open and distance learning environments. Moving from stationary to mobile learning allows informal collaboration and interaction between learners. Therefore, there is a necessity to revise peopleâ??s psychological factors, process and mechanisms that underlie M-learning so that the practice can move from technology-centred implementation to human-centred effective learning processes.  The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 12.0 and Rasch Model Analysis was used to measure these items. The 5-point Likert scale questionnaires (12 items) being sent to 105 distance education students from four courses including Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Social Science and Bachelor of Management which was distributed in tutorial sessions during the annual residential intensive course in the main campus of the Universiti Sains Malaysia by their respective course managers. The finding shows that a positive response from the learners as they feel happy to use this additional learning tools (mobile learning). Learnerâ??s feel supported and motivated to use the mobile application with the usability of simple language."
222,Mobile Learning Via SMS Among Distance Learners:  Does Learning Transfer Occur?,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether learners are willing to transfer learning in this mobile learning environment via SMS.  The reason for this is to measure the effectiveness of the new method used in learning and education especially in distance education field.  For this reason, studentsâ?? responses are gathered which looked at three factors namely learner characteristic, learning design and learning environment. The data are gathered through a survey research design with questionnaires using five-point likert scale. The questionnaires was administered for 105 distance education students from four courses including Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Social Science and Bachelor of Management. The Rasch Model Analysis was used to measure these dimensions. Rasch Model is a one-parameter logistic model within item response theory (IRT) whereby the amount of a given latent trait in a person and the amount of that same latent trait reflected in various items can be estimated independently yet still compared explicitly to one another.  The result of the study showed that learning transfer occurred and being influenced most by learnerâ??s characteristics especially in term of their motivation as well as their perceive utility/value of the SMS learning to their job and academic performances."
