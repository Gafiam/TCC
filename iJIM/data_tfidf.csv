48,Supporting Factors for the Implementation of Mobile Learning for Elementary School Students Using an Authentic Approach and Real-World Activities,"The aim of this research is to determine the supporting factors for the implementation of mobile learning for elementary school students in Indonesia using an authentic approach and real-world activities. This is significant because various approaches to mobile learning have been used in elementary institutions. However, this educational model is not ideal because the data shows that 92% of students have learning difficulties, and 38% state they do not receive teachers guidance.The method used was descriptive quantitative with the population of elementary school students and a purposively selected sample of 26 of those pupils. Samples were taken based on the characteristics of the coastal area and city center. To assess their entry behavior, questionnaires and test sheets were used. Moreover, data was gathered through home visits and the Whatsapp application. It was then processed using the percentage technique and the SmartPLS application, to obtain accurate results. In addition, a qualitative approach was used to develop the analysis.According to the results, the supporting factors for the implementation of mobile learning using an authentic approach and real-world activities are as follows: 1) students already have the concrete and logical thinking skills, 2) the entry behavior of students are still low, and 3) visual and auditory learning styles affect meaningful learning. Furthermore, research suggests that teachers and learning designers should create mobile learning exercises which support authentic learning and real-world pursuits. ,"

77,"Solving Technological, Pedagogical, and Psychological Problems in Mobile Learning","This paper aims to explore the various problems associated with the technological, pedagogical, and psychological aspects of mobile learning and develop recommendations for its improvement.  Mobile learning becomes increasingly popular today. This type of learning is relatively new. It has recently gained popularity due to the pandemic restrictions in 2020. As mobile learning is being actively used, educators, students, and other professionals begin to note its positive and negative sides.  The study is based on the method of experiment as well as an online 11-item questionnaire was conducted (developed by authors) with 110 teachers in Russian universities (Russian State University named by A.N. Kosygina, I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, and Kuban State Technological University).  The practical significance and prospects for further research are based on the possibility of using the results in further study of the problem of the impact of mobile applications on specific indicators.  It was found that, given the great prevalence of mobile devices today, there is every reason to implement mobile learning at universities. However, there are infrastructural problems that prevent the widespread use of this mode of delivery (problems with the Internet, old gadgets that do not support 4G, lack of technical support, etc.). Teachers also mention a set of problems associated with the quality of such training, which are mainly related to pedagogical and psychological aspects of the process. About 56% of university teachers say that students often behave irresponsibly during online classes. They are inattentive, tend to skip lessons, and do not hand in the tasks, which leads to a decline of knowledge and failing at tests and exams. Around 68% of teachers have difficulties adapting their teaching methods to a mobile learning environment.   This study proposes structured recommendations to improve the quality of mobile learning by advancing technology skills, adapting mobile learning to the needs of universities, and raising the motivation of teachers and students.  The results of the study can be used to analyze and compare the impact of mobile learning on society, efficiency in various fields, as well as mobile learning of students on future employment and life in society.In the future it will be important to conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of mobile learning on students and teachers, to study the effectiveness of such learning in general.,"
93,Factors Influencing the Acceptance of Mobile Learning in K-12 Education in Saudi Arabia: Towards a Shift in the Saudi Education System vis-à-vis Saudi 2030 Vision,"The Saudi Arabian government is committed to updating and improving its education system. Thus, in March 2017, a project was declared to convert the existing book-based methodology to modern, mobile technology in the K-12 education space by 2021. As part of this process, a deep-dive literature review of student acceptance of mobile learning confirmed that there was limited research into what elements had an effect on how much students were likely to accept learning with mobile applications in the five to 18-year-old demographic of K-12. The conclusion of the literature review was that the Saudi Arabian Education Ministry must acquire an understanding of these elements in order to strategize the implementation of the new technology. This study approached high school students, aged 16 – 18, in Saudi Arabia, to examine the elements which would influence their acceptance of mobile learning technology. The research consolidated known elements of education, namely learning self-management, system quality, and hedonic motivation with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to create a significant theoretical model for the new technology in a high school setting. Conclusions were drawn that societal influence did not affect the students approach to mobile learning, but that learning self-management, the expectancy of effort and performance, hedonic motivation and the quality of the system did affect the acceptance behaviour of the students. It was also noted that gender was not a significant factor in the study"
95,Factors Affecting Students Desire to Take Upcoming Online Courses after E-learning Experience During Covid 19,"Since 2020, Covid 19 has completely changed the daily activities of almost all nations, and education has been heavily affected.

318,"Organizing, performing and presenting scientific work in engineering education with the help of mobile devices","The meaningful use of mobile devices in higher education learning contexts is still underrepresented at German universities. Even if these “new” technologies open up totally new teaching and learning experiences the current use is strongly dominated by simple technology provision. With a special coursedesigned for engineering studentsthe authors want to change this and go more into the direction of meaningful interaction and collaboration with the help of mobile devices throughout the learning process. The course is developed to give the students the opportunity to use tablet PCs in context of their studies and simultaneously to improve their ability in the field of scientific working processes. Making use of the online tool Evernote supported this aim. This tool allows users to work out and share digital notebooks and with this to organize as well as document a working process. In this case it was used to support a scientific research process from the beginning to the end. As Evernote can be used with an mobile app it easily can be used on tablet PCs. Hence, it supports the course idea of using mobile devices in perfect way. The course itself is divided into four face-to-face meetings and three working phases. By taking part in the course the students go through their own research project with explicit stepsfrom having a new idea for research to the results presentation. The meetings are mainly used in order to introduce tools or techniques for research processes. During the working phases the students do their research, create presentations, a poster, and a scientific report. Based on the internal course evaluation and the students feedback we observed, that the combination of tablet PCs with the Evernote software is a good opportunity to show how mobile devices can be meaningfully integrated into higher engineering education."
327,Security of m-learning system: A collective responsibility,"Innovation in learning technologies and services is driven by demands from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in order to meet their students needs and make knowledge delivery easier. The technology could play a pivotal role in extending the possibilities for teaching, learning, and research in educational institutions. M-learning emerged from this innovation as a result of an unprecedented explosion in the number of mobile devices due to availability and affordability of mobile phones, smartphones and tablets among students. Competition in the mobile device industry is also encouraging developers to be innovative, constantly striving to introduce new features. Consequently, newer sources of risks are being introduced in the mobile computing paradigm at manufacturing level. Similarly, many m-learning promoters and developers focus on developing and delivering learning content and infrastructure for m-learning system without adequate consideration for security of stakeholders data, whereas the use of these mobile technologies for learning poses a serious threat to confidentiality, integrity and privacy of those involved in teaching and learning, yet traditional security threats are also evolving. Against this backdrop, the stakeholders in education sector (i.e. education providers, educators, m-learning promoters and developers) should begin to consider the security implications of these devices in modern teaching and learning environments. The purpose of this paper is to identify the m-learning security issues that stakeholders may face, how they are being affected by the security threats,  who among is stakeholders are affected or most affected by security issues in m-learning using three Nigeria universities as case studies and what are the responsibilities of the stakeholders in ensuring risk free m-learning."

604,An Educational Ontology-based M-Learning System,"Smart devices applications can assist young children in improving their learning capabilities and comprehension skills. However most of learning applications are built without taking into consideration the effective needs and background of Arab users. They are somehow incompatible with their local environment and culture. We propose in this paper a mobile-based educational system that displays illustrations automatically to characterize the content of children stories on animal domain, and we use some intelligent technique to answer users questions using an educational ontology. The generation of illustrations passes through different phases which include text processing, extraction of word-to-word relationships, building and accessing an ontology, and using Internet search engines for retrieval of complimentary information. The system can be used also by instructors to teach the children in a non-conventional manner. They can customize semantically the structure of the questions and determine how the answers will be displayed. In order to customize questions and answers, we have defined a semantic infrastructure to define the logic of terms, and the workflow of answers. The aim of our system is to improve the children educational skills to grasp vocabulary and grammar using multimedia with a portable smart device which includes observation, comprehension, realization, and deduction. Children will then be able to continue learning outside the limited time of their schools and from any location."

683,Towards a New Scalable Big Data System Semantic Web Applied on Mobile Learning,"In Web 3.0, semantic data gives machines the ability to understand and process data. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the liagna franca of Semantic Web. While Big Data handles the problematic of storing and processing massive data, it still does not provide a support for RDF data. In this paper, we present a new Big Data semantic web comprised of a classical Big Data system with a semantic layer. As a proof of concept of our approach, we use Mobile-learning as a case study. The architecture we propose is composed of two main parts: a knowledge server and an adaptation model. The knowledge server allows trainers and business experts to represent their expertise using business rules and ontology to ensure heterogeneous knowledge. Then, in a mobility environment, the knowledge server makes it possible to take into account the constraints of the environment and the user constraints thanks to the RDF exchange format. The adaptation model based on RDF graphs corresponds to combinatorial optimization algorithms, whose objective is to propose to the learner a relevant combination of Learning Object based on its contextual constraints. Our solution guarantees scalability, and high data availability through the use of the principle of replication. The results obtained in the system evaluation experiments, on a large number of servers show the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our system if the amount of data processed is very large."

98,Leveraging Smartphone Sensors for Detecting Abnormal Gait for Smart Wearable Mobile Technologies,"Walking is one of the most common modes of terrestrial locomotion for humans. Walking is essential for humans to perform most kinds of daily activities. When a person walks, there is a pattern in it, and it is known as gait. Gait analysis is used in sports and healthcare. We can analyze this gait in different ways, like using video captured by the surveillance cameras or depth image cameras in the lab environment. It also can be recognized by wearable sensors. e.g., accelerometer, force sensors, gyroscope, flexible goniometer, magneto resistive sensors, electromagnetic tracking system, force sensors, and electromyography (EMG). Analysis through these sensors required a lab condition, or users must wear these sensors. For detecting abnormality in gait action of a human, we need to incorporate the sensors separately. We can know about one's health condition by abnormal human gait after detecting it. Understanding a regular gait vs. abnormal gait may give insights to the health condition of the subject using the smart wearable technologies. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a way to analyze abnormal human gait through smartphone sensors. Though smart devices like smartphones and smartwatches are used by most of the person nowadays. So, we can track down their gait using sensors of these intelligent wearable devices. In this study, we used twenty-three () people to record their walking activities. Among them fourteen people have normal gait actions, and nine people were facing difficulties with their walking due to their illness. To do the stratification of the gait of the subjects, we have adopted five machine learning algorithms with addition a deep learning algorithm. The advantages of the traditional classification are analyzed and compared among themselves. After rigorous performance analysis we found support vector machine (SVM) showing 96% accuracy, highest among the tradition classifiers. 70%, 84%, and 95% accuracy is obtained by the logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifiers, respectively. As per the state-of-the art, deep learning classifiers has been proven to outperform the traditional classifiers in similar binary classification problems. We have considered the scenario and applied the 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) classification algorithm, which outperformed the other algorithms showing accuracy of 98%. The model can be optimized and can be integrated with the other sensors to be utilized in the mobile wearable devices.,"
175,Leveraging Sensor Fusion and Sensor-Body Position for Activity Recognition for Wearable Mobile Technologies,"Smart devices like smartphones and smartwatches have made this world smarter. These wearable devices are created through complex research methodologies to make them more usable and interactive with its user. Various interactive mobile applications such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) or mixed reality (MR) applications solely depend on the in-built sensors of the smart devices. A lot of facilities can be taken from these devices with sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope. Different physical activities such as walking, jogging, sitting, etc., can be important for analysis like health state prediction and duration of exercise by using those sensors based on artificial intelligence. In this paper, we have implemented machine learning and deep learning algorithms to detect and recognize eight activities namely, walking, jogging, standing, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, sitting-in-a-car and cycling; with a maximum of 99.3% accuracy. A few activities are almost similar in action, such as sitting and sitting-in-a-car, but difficult to distinguish; which makes it more challenging to predict tasks. In this paper, we have hypothesized that with more sensors (sensor fusion) and data collection points (sensor-body positions) a wide range of activities can be recognized and the recognition accuracies can be increased. Finally, we showed that the combination of all the sensors data of both pocket/waist and wrist can be used to recognize a wide range of activities accurately. The possibility of using the proposed methodologies for futuristic mobile technologies is quite significant. The adaptation of most recent deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional Long Short Time Memory (Bi-LSTM) demonstrated high credibility of the methods presented as experimentation.,"

588,A Sentiment Analysis Tool for Determining the Promotional Success of Fashion Images on Instagram,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) or Opinion Mining is the process of analysing natural language texts to detect an emotion or a pattern of emotions towards a certain product to make a decision about that product. SA is a topic of text mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web mining disciplines. Research in SA is currently at its peak given the amount of data generated from social media networks. The concept is that consumers are expressing exactly what they need, want and expect from a product but on the other hand the companies dont have the tools to analyse and understand these feelings to satisfy these consumers accordingly. One of the applications that generate a high rate of reactions and sentiments in social networks is Instagram. This study focuses on analysing the reactions generated by the top 50 fashion houses on Instagram given their top 20 images with the highest number of likes. The approach taken in this study is to qualify the visual aesthetics of fashion images and to establish why some succeed on social media more than others. The basic question asked in this paper is whether there are certain visual aesthetics that appeal more to the user and are therefore more successful on social media than others as determined by a measure we introduce, ‘Social Value. To do so, a sentiment analysis tool is developed to measure the proposed social value of each image. An input of comments from each image will be processed. Each comment will go through a pre-processing phase; each word will be placed through a lexicon to identify if it is positive or negative. The output of the lexicon is a score value assigned to each comment to identify its degree of positivity, negativity, or it has no effect on the social value. Adding to these results, the number of likes and shares would also be taken into consideration quantifying the images value. A cumulative result is then produced to determine the social value of an image.,"
