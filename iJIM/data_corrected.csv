33,Framework for Gamification of Online Training Platforms for Employee Engagement Enhancement,",online training; gamification; game elements; engagement; employee,","2022-03-22,","Organizations have moved away from traditional classroom-based training to online training whereby employees can attend courses at their convenience either at home or in the workplace. This transition has been fuelled by lockdowns that governments worldwide have implemented to counter the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, where employees are expected to work or attend training from home. However, several issues including lack of employee engagement hinder the effective delivery of online corporate training. In recent years, gamification has been identified as a solution to lack of engagement in education. Gamification involves the incorporation of game elements into non-game applications to encourage user engagement, where different combinations are used for different learning contexts. However, little research has been done to identify suitable game elements for the gamification of corporate online training. This study proposes a set of game elements to improve employee engagement with online training platforms. A step-by-step analysis of the literature led to the identification of nine potentially suitable game elements. These elements were evaluated by a group of experts selected from five well-known training providers in Saudi Arabia, who completed a semi-structured interview questionnaire about the usability, completeness, and usefulness of the elements. The result of the evaluation indicated that the identified game elements will be able to effectively and efficiently improve employee engagement. The set of nine game elements was then incorporated into a proposed framework for the gamification of online training platforms to enhance employee engagement.,"

Many technology-based games have been introduced in the market; however, not all games are suitable for student learning. This is because the features of a game must have an impact on education; it is essential to choose a game based on appropriate criteria for education. Therefore, this paper describes the integration process of game-based learning features outlined by Alaswad and Nadolny (2015), which are goal,    interaction and feedback. The three features are designed in a learning kit called the “Kit Pengembara” for learning the topic of “Arah Mata Angin” and     “Bearing Sudutan”, the subject of Geography Form 1. In addition, this Kit Pengembara also integrates the UniteAR application for user to complete a  given task using augmented reality.

86,Machine Learning Models to Predict Students Study Path Selection,",educational data mining, decision trees, random forest, and logistic regressions,","2022-01-18,","Selecting a proper study path in higher education is a difficult task for many students. They either have a lack of knowledge on the study path offered or are unsure of their interest in the various options. The current educational setups enable us to collect valid and reliable data on student success and learning behaviour. This study explores and solves the problem of what path to select by proposing possible study paths with the help of machine learning algorithms.  Learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) are technologies that aid in the analysis of educational data. In this quantitative study, we applied a questionnaire to collect data from students at the Business Information Technology Department (Bite) at the Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science. We managed to collect 101 samples from students during 2017–2018. We used various machine learning algorithms and prediction models to assess the best approach for study path selection.  We applied three performance scores of accuracy, Cohens Kappa, and ROC curve to measure the accuracy of the algorithm results. KNIME analytics was selected as a proper tool to pre-process, prepare, analyse, and model the data. The results indicate that Random Forest (94% accuracy) and Decision Tree (93% accuracy) are the best classification models for students study path selection. The contribution of this study is for educational data mining research to assess the comparison of various algorithms. Furthermore, this is a novel approach to predict students study path selection, which educational institutes should develop to assist students in their study path selection."
87,Android Malware Detection with Deep Learning using RNN from Opcode Sequences,",Android, Malware, Opcodes, Recurrent Neural Networks,","2022-01-18,","Android is the most widely used operating system in smartphones. Mobile users can download and access apps easily from the play store. Due to lack of security awareness and risk associated with mobile apps, malware apps would be downloaded by normal users in general. The consequences after installing a malware app are unpredictable. Malware apps can gather user personal data, browsing history, user profiles, user sensitive data like passwords. Hence, android malware detection is essential for providing security to mobile users. Android malware detection using machine learning is done either by extracting static features (opcodes, permissions, intents, system commands) or by extracting dynamic features (log behavior, system calls, dataflow). In this paper, opcode sequences are extracted from malware and benign apps, and Recurrent Neural Networks are proposed on extracted sequences. Benign apps are collected from the play store, apkpure.com and malware apps are collected from the virus share website. The proposed Recurrent Neural Network model could achieve 96% accuracy for android malware detection.,"
88,Weight Influence of Logarithmic and Exponential Functions on the Selection of Wireless Networks Using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods,",Multi Criteria Decision Making, AHP, TOPSIS,","2022-01-18,","This research aims to study the influence of logarithmic and exponential functions on the multi-criteria decision-making algorithm that changes the linear to the nonlinear method. It is carried out to better understand the multi-criteria decision-making (TOPSIS) algorithm whereby these functions may influence the criteria weights during the selection of the best network. The experiment is applied under different network types to evaluate the most optimum network that leads to better throughput, low latency, minimum BER, and low price per MB. The algorithms are assessed in MATLAB simulation environments. In addition, the adoption of the Wi-Fi networks standard is determined by factors such as bandwidth, signal to noise ratio and the channel modulation technique during the decision-making process. The simulation results showed that the exponential function had produced approximately similar results to that of linear TOPSIS algorithm because both keep the weights to demonstrate positive values. However, logarithmic TOPSIS produced different results and a worst-case scenario, as the weights have negative values which lead to a phase shift of 180⁰ during the decision process. Thus, linear TOPSIS was found to have the best results while logarithmic TOPSIS had the worst outcome.,"

It broadens the spectrum band to millimeter-waves, employs multiple numerologies to calculate subcarrier spacing, and supports various division duplex modes. Furthermore, the fifth generation of mobile networks intends to employ both, frequency division duplex, and time division duplex. This study focuses on Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode. Compared to the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), the time duplex mode enhances flexibility and allows efficient frequency spectrum usage. However, the recent papers addressing resource scheduling issues for TDD duplex employ only the current classical schedulers, which were primarily designed for FDD mode, to accomplish radio resource allocation. In this paper, we compared the achievable throughput and data accumulated in the buffer of these schedulers to assess their suitability and compatibility with TDD specifications. The resulting performances show that an appropriate scheduler in line with TDD requirements should be implemented to exploit the available spectrum efficiently and reach the required throughput."

The study of students ability and motivation to use modern technologies of mobile learning is characterized by novelty. However, the problematic issue of studying the motivation of students and teachers for mobile learning in today's pandemic remains relevant. The purpose of the study is to examine some aspects of the formation of students' motivation (intrinsic motivation: interest in the subject of study, understanding of its significance for further career; extrinsic motivation: points, awards, recognition), as well as the role of teachers in this process and the influence of cognitive abilities of a person on their motivation and academic achievement. The study is based on the method of experiment as well as the interviews and analysis of student reports. There were 185 students (19-22 years old) from Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and Far Eastern Federal University participating in the study. After the participants had listened to an online lecture on the topic ""Neuro-linguistic programming"", they were asked to make a report on the topic of the same name and expand the information. Next, the students were interviewed. The results showed that 89% of students were interested in the issue and 69% noted a desire to learn more information on this topic; 100% of participants actively use mobile devices with Internet access for educational purposes and, in particular, for making the required report. However, only 12% of respondents believe that mobile learning alone can be used in order to study specialized disciplines at their university. Thus, 43% of students find it difficult to perceive information from the screen of a smartphone (tablet); 61% of students prefer traditional education to mobile learning, which is probably due to the novelty of this process; 65% of respondents noticed that their knowledge is deteriorating due to the use of mobile (distance) learning. In connection with the results obtained, the following recommendations were made to improve the educational process: to explain to students the importance and usefulness of the topic under study; to use adequate pedagogical methods in the context of mobile learning; to provide feedback and the ability to communicate to students during mobile learning; to take into account the personality and learning style of a student; to use all types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of students in accordance with specific circumstances. The most popular motivation factors for mobile learning are possibility of improving exam grades (65%), possibility of improving knowledge (25%), and broadening horizons and deep interest in the topic (10%). Developing applications that will take into account the needs of a particular university and specialty will also make a contribution. Teachers are also encouraged to use a play-based approach and a student reward system in order to increase the level of motivation (additional points, a simplified exam scheme, etc.). The practical significance and prospects for further research are presented by the opportunities of increasing students motivation in the context of mobile learning, and, consequently, the success of their studies. The results can be used in the comparative study of mobile learning possibilities in modern conditions and teachers involvement in it in different countries.,"

Walking is essential for humans to perform most kinds of daily activities. When a person walks, there is a pattern in it, and it is known as gait. Gait analysis is used in sports and healthcare. We can analyze this gait in different ways, like using video captured by the surveillance cameras or depth image cameras in the lab environment. It also can be recognized by wearable sensors. e.g., accelerometer, force sensors, gyroscope, flexible goniometer, magneto resistive sensors, electromagnetic tracking system, force sensors, and electromyography (EMG). Analysis through these sensors required a lab condition, or users must wear these sensors. For detecting abnormality in gait action of a human, we need to incorporate the sensors separately. We can know about one's health condition by abnormal human gait after detecting it. Understanding a regular gait vs. abnormal gait may give insights to the health condition of the subject using the smart wearable technologies. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a way to analyze abnormal human gait through smartphone sensors. Though smart devices like smartphones and smartwatches are used by most of the person nowadays. So, we can track down their gait using sensors of these intelligent wearable devices. In this study, we used twenty-three () people to record their walking activities. Among them fourteen people have normal gait actions, and nine people were facing difficulties with their walking due to their illness. To do the stratification of the gait of the subjects, we have adopted five machine learning algorithms with addition a deep learning algorithm.

This has been deterring people from going out shopping and instead resort to online shopping. This has affected the sales and revenue of departmental chains. Also, people spend quite a considerable amount of time searching through rows in order to find the items of their choice. Proposing a solution to these above-mentioned problems using technology is a real boon.  Installing a payment option on the cart itself would result in cutting down the waiting times in queues. Moreover, the customers can also benefit from navigation through the virtual maps that would be displayed on the screens of the carts. This reduces the time wasted by customers in searching for products. Hence the customers are self-dependent during their shopping. For the retail group, their transactions and management are truly simplified with these developments. Additionally, the counter labor will decrease if not cease to zero, which in turn reduces the labor cost drastically. In times of pandemic like now, people have been sticking with online shopping due to various reasons, but they long to go out and spend time in the malls as they would in normal times.

140,Vehicular Networks Performance Evaluation Based on Downlink Scheduling Algorithms for High-Speed Long Term Evolution – Vehicle,",LTE-V, Best-CQI, Round Robin, Proportional Fair, LoS,","2021-11-09,","Moving is the key to modern life. Most things are in moving such as vehicles and user mobiles, so the need for high-speed wireless networks to serve the high demand of the wireless application becomes essential for any wireless network design. The use of web browsing, online gaming, and on-time data exchange like video calls as an example means that users need a high data rate and fewer error communication links. To satisfy this, increasing the bandwidth available for each network will enhance the throughput of the communication, but the bandwidth available is a limited resource which means that thinking about techniques to be used to increase the throughput of the network is very important. One of the techniques used is the spectrum sharing between the available networks, but the problem here is when there is no available channel to connect with. This encourages researchers to think about using scheduling as a technique to serve the high capacity on the network. Studying scheduling techniques depends on the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the network, so the throughput performance is the metric of this paper. In this paper, an improved Best-CQI scheduling algorithm is proposed to enhance the throughput of the network. The proposed algorithm was compared with three user scheduling algorithms to evaluate the throughput performance which are Round Robin (RR), Proportional Fair (PF), and Best-CQI algorithms. The study is performed under Line-of-Sight (LoS) link at carrier frequency 2.6 GHz to satisfy the Vehicular Long Term Evolution (LTE-V) with the high-speed scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the throughput performance of the other algorithms.,"

This research study and simulation examine the design and evaluation performance of Radio Frequency over FSO (RF-FSO) wireless communication technology. These systems are implemented through medium communication link ranges to overcome excessive sensitivity of atmosphere medium and meet the requirements of a wide variety of optical wireless applications. There are two ways to achieve the application of the design mentioned above. The first way is the application of the  Three modulation schemes of technology that is Amplitude shift keying (ASK), Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) of digital modulation. The design of these modulation schemes is realized by using optiwave software to study the transmission of RF signals over the FSO channel and compare the three modulation techniques into the RF-FSO system. RF signals with the frequency range from (20 to 60) GHz is used in RF-FSO system and many carrier optical signals where the higher RF has a wider bandwidth to carrying larger information. To increase the transmission of data rates Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology is used. The second way is based on a mathematical model which has been proposed for this study. This mathematical model calculates optimal beacon period (BI), and optimal listen interval (LI) to preventing the overlapping of time between the signals and the decrease in the required power. Using different weather conditions samples, the simulation results revealed that the best performance of the RF-FSO system is from link range, and the receiver is more sensitive. The simulation results are as follows: Two independent channels are transmitted 20 Gbps over ranges from (263 m to 6.55 km), while four channels are transmitted 40 Gbps over ranges from (257 m to 5.95 km), and eight independent channels transmit 80 Gbps over distance from (203 m to 5.2 km)"

As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, several people have drawn parallels to influenza. While both viruses cause respiratory infections, they propagate in very different ways. This has a major impact on the public health measures that can be used to fight each virus. These viruses are pandemic-causing in the same way. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, and can present themselves in several ways, ranging from asymptomatic to severe and deadly. A proposal is presented in this paper that uses two algorithms to define and classify these pandemics, they are: The Back Propagation (BP) classification algorithm and the Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering algorithm. Two stages are implemented in the proposed system: in the first step, the FCM algorithm is used to find out the type of virus, and this algorithm is capable of handling ambiguous features of viruses. In the second step, a BP neural network is used as a classifier to detect the pandemic class. The proposed system was trained and tested using a well-known dataset (covid-19 vs influenza). Information Gain (IG) is used to optimize the related features that affect the classification process to improve speed and accuracy.  The proposed mobile application is developed to support users easily detecting the COVID-19 infection by inputting the medical tests as significant features to the proposed system. The proposed system's accuracy is up to (89%), the framework was created using the Matlab programming environment and an Android Studio for Mobil application designing.,"

A cluster is a dynamic collection of mobile hosts called peers and are clustered around a single mobile host called a centroid to form a temporary work group for processing and exchanging information. All peers are connected to the centroid using a short range wireless network. All peers and the centroid are members of a peer connected set. The centroid is chosen in such a way that it has a strong connection to the mobile support station. After collecting data from a server, the centroid is free to disconnect from the server and ready to create its own cluster of peers.  To process various transactions at the centroid, a dynamically configurable data processing space is created called the envelope repository. Processed data is kept at a private work space of the centroid in an envelope and brought to the envelope repository whenever required. A peer initiates a jumping transaction to fetch data objects to the centroid. The jumping transaction initiates an envelope transaction to acquire the necessary locks on data objects at envelope repository. After getting the locks, intension transaction processes the data objects to give the result stored in an envelope. Envelope intension write protocol is designed to make jumping transactions globally serialized."

We combine this learning approach with our Mobile Context-aware and Adaptive Learning Schedule (mCALS) tool which will create and enhance opportunities for students to study or learn in different locations. The learning schedule is used for two purposes, a) to help students organize their work and facilitate time management, and b) for capturing the usersâ?? activities which can be retrieved and translated as learning contexts later by our tool. These contexts are then used as a basis for selecting appropriate learning materials for the students. Using a learning schedule to capture and retrieve contexts is a novel approach in the context-aware mobile learning field. In this paper, we present the conceptual model and preliminary architecture of our mCALS tool, as well as our research questions and methodology for evaluating it. The learning materials we intend to use for our tool will be Java for novice programmers. This is appropriate because large amounts of time and motivation are necessary to learn an object-oriented programming language such as Java, and we are currently seeking ways to facilitate this for novice programmers."

For that purpose all mobile services, including m-learning ones, demand special attention being paid to interaction with the user. While mobile device applications are becoming more powerful, their development process must utilize the concepts of universal access and universal usability. This paper describes the model of both adaptable and adaptive mobile user interface, through the introduction of a transformable menu component capable to be personalized to each individual user with respect to her/his preferences and interaction style. We discuss the use of customization and adaptation techniques, with the aim to both enhance mobile HCI and to increase user satisfaction, particularly when working with graphically rich m-learning applications."
303,The Role of Podcasts in Studentsâ?? Learning,",higher education, m-learning, podcast, ubiquitous learning,","2008-06-15,","Podcasts have been employed extensively in some countries and are now being trialed at a number of universities in Australia. They allow ubiquitous learning whereby students can access a variety of educational material anywhere, anytime on iPods, MP3 players or even desktop computers. There remain many questions about the impact of podcasts on studentsâ?? learning. One issue is how podcasts can be used to support high quality, experiential learning rather than merely perpetuating the old transmission model of education. In this paper, we explore the reasons why students either use, or fail to use, podcasts provided for their education. We report on the motivation of students enrolled in a large first-year information systems subject. These varied considerably and show that podcasts are a useful adjunct for providing for the diverse range of learning styles of our students. However, we also conclude that further research is needed into the use of podcasts to promote deeper learning in our students and how podcasts can act as a support tool for other forms of m-learning."
304,An Adaptation of E-learning Standards to M-learning,",e-learning, interoperability, m-learning, LOM, IMS LD,","2008-05-15,","The exploitation of technological advances in learning has result in an exponential progress in this field through e-learning applications in the last decade, and currently through the emergence of a new concept called m-learning. M-learning is defined as the use of mobile technologies for learning; m-learning must benefit from e-learning technological advances in order to avoid reinventing the wheel. Nevertheless, m-learning, which is characterized by the use of mobile devices, permits, for example, the learners' mobility during their learning, and, as opposed to e-learning, allows a continuous change of the context. Moreover, m-learning faces some constraints caused by the use of its mobile technologies such as the limited screen size, reduced energy, resolution capacity and location change during an activity. Yet, there is an agreement among most research laboratories interested in e- and m- learning on the parallel use of these two learning environments. Therefore, it would be more sensible to allow communication and exchanges, to facilitate the sharing of learning subject matters and data between the two environments, and thereby to avoid the reproduction of contents that already exist. In other words, an educational heritage which is exploitable independently of the environment of its development must be created. The utilization of standards can offer pedagogical contents some structures which facilitate the interchangeability between e- and m- learning. In order to ensure the interoperability between e- and â??m learning platforms and to take into account the specificities of m-learning, we have adopted the already existing standard LOM and the specification IMS LD."

Un-derstanding how to model the complexity of mobile work and particularly its mobile interaction would be beneficial in ensuring the success of mobile services in userâ??s long-term, goal-oriented usage. Previous attempts to evaluate success factors in mobile business services have concen-trated on rigid analytical tools modeling users and tasks and mainly focusing on understanding routine work tasks and standard information exchange between different users. However, this covers only a narrow field of mobile work and it is argued here that existing analytical tools do not suffi-ciently consider factors arising from different levels of mo-bility and the temporariness and non-routine tasks of mo-bile work. In this paper we present a process oriented ap-proach, 'MoBiS Map, derived from Actor-Network theory, to describe the complex network of interactions and the transformation of interactions. We argue that our approach is a useful analytical tool when the focus is on examining the transformation of interactions that takes place when mobile work services are implemented. This is a methodological paper aiming to better understand the transformation of mobile interactions, and therefore to support development of mobile business services."

Recently finished research projects - e.g. like the PeTEX project done by universities in Dortmund (Germany), Palermo (Italy) and Stockholm (Sweden) â?? implemented an opportunity to do experiential learning by using real laboratory equipment without being physically in the laboratory but having access via the internet. A question in this context is, how students can document their learning process and show to others (teachers and/or other students), what they have been doing. Making the whole environment available for mobile devices so that students have access from virtually everywhere and every time is the consequent further development. With this work in progress paper we show what kind of role e-portfolios can play in the learning process and which kind of scenarios are possible using the software on mobile devices. Furthermore, we show that the combination of experiential learning and the use of e-portfolios offer a great potential to promote the learnersâ?? creativity. This unique combination of topics is realized within one subtask of the project â??ELLI â?? Excellent Teaching and Learning in Engineering Educationâ? at TU Dortmund University."

Mobile learning (M-learning) is a recent technology that has been developed rapidly to deliver E-learning using personal mobile devices without posing any restrictions on time and location. In this work, we investigate students and faculty members attitudes towards the use of M-learning in higher educational institutions within two countries in the Gulf Region (Oman & UAE). Two questionnaire surveys have been conducted: one for students and another for faculty members. In these surveys, 383 students and 54 instructors have taken part within the study. An independent sample t-test was performed to examine whether there exist a significant difference among the students attitudes and the faculty members attitudes towards the use of M-learning with regard to gender and country. Results indicated that students in the UAE were more positive towards the use of M-learning than those in Oman. Moreover, results revealed that 99% of the students own mobile devices, in particular smartphones and tablets, while only 1% has not. Results of this study could help policy makers for better decision making in building the M-learning infrastructure in the higher educational institutions in general and specifically within the Arab Gulf region."

Even if these “new” technologies open up totally new teaching and learning experiences the current use is strongly dominated by simple technology provision. With a special course—designed for engineering students—the authors want to change this and go more into the direction of meaningful interaction and collaboration with the help of mobile devices throughout the learning process. The course is developed to give the students the opportunity to use tablet PCs in context of their studies and simultaneously to improve their ability in the field of scientific working processes. Making use of the online tool Evernote supported this aim. This tool allows users to work out and share digital notebooks and with this to organize as well as document a working process. In this case it was used to support a scientific research process from the beginning to the end. As Evernote can be used with an mobile app it easily can be used on tablet PCs. Hence, it supports the course idea of using mobile devices in perfect way. The course itself is divided into four face-to-face meetings and three working phases. By taking part in the course the students go through their own research project with explicit steps—from having a new idea for research to the results presentation. The meetings are mainly used in order to introduce tools or techniques for research processes. During the working phases the students do their research, create presentations, a poster, and a scientific report. Based on the internal course evaluation and the students feedback we observed, that the combination of tablet PCs with the Evernote software is a good opportunity to show how mobile devices can be meaningfully integrated into higher engineering education."

That is, they cannot functionally communicate with others using their voice. Despite that substantial fraction, we still know very little about these individuals, their abilities, and their needs. ""We still know very little about the cognitive capabilities of nonverbal people with autism, and how best to help them learn to communicate,"" said Geri Dawson, Ph.D., Autism Speaks chief science officer.Non-verbal people with autism are usually unable to communicate normally using natural languages. They can, however, learn to communicate through specific symbols and images. Special education instructors have adopted this method of communication to teach non-verbal people with autism. They introduce the symbols and images to them through different methodologies. This learning process appeared to be effective but it is very long. The process is carried out manually and requires a lots of times, dedication, and resources. The instructors should find the materials in different formats and circumstances. They should repeat the lessons several times and normally in a face-to-face framework. We propose in this paper a mobile-based application that allows non- verbal people with autism to learn and communicate with their surroundings using a smart device. They can then be taught to use specific symbols and images through the smart mobile phones. They can form simple words and sentences to express their feelings and needs. The application is flexible and allows the addition of new contents very easily. To assess the progress of the users, different exercises and puzzles are proposed. These allow the users to improve their skills and to continue learning outside the classrooms."

In the emerging field of Augmented Reality (AR), research needs comprise finding the optimal information density, the interplay between orientation data in the background and other information layers, using the appropriate graphical variables for display, or selecting real-time base data with adequate quality and suitable spatial accuracy. In this paper we present a concept for integrating real-time data into 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) AR environments, i.e., data with “high” spatial and temporal variations. We focus on three research challenges: 1.) high-performance integration of real-time data into AR; 2.) usability design in terms of displaying spatio-temporal developments and the interaction with the application; and 3.) design considerations regarding reality vs. virtuality, visualisation complexity and information density. We validated our approach in a prototypical application and extracted several limitations and future research areas including natural feature recognition, the cross-connection of (oftentimes monolithic) AR interface developments and well-established cartographic principles, or fostering the understanding of the temporal context in dynamic 4D Augmented Reality environments."

High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) arises after the OFDM stage and reduces the performance of the used nonlinear devices. Therefore, a new stage has been imposed between the MIMO and OFDM block.  It is based on the entropy meaning of the wavelet transformation to trigger a proposed thresholding criterion and reconstruct the OFDM signal. As a result, the probability of high PAPR appearance will be limited and reduced; a promising result over our recently published work has been conducted; 15-25% extra reduction. This work could be denoted by MIMO-OFDM based on Entropy Wavelet Transform (MO-EWT) systems.  The MO-EWT validity has been checked based on either numerical analysis or conducted simulation based on MATLAB; where 80% improvement of reducing the high PAPR has been achieved over the literature. These results have been reached using the same environment conditions and at additional cost and complexity of the transceivers structure."

This research attempts to analyze in-service and pre-service teachers' attitudes and decisions regarding mathematics teaching with mobile phones using activity theory. More specifically, three case studies are analyzed in this research: One concerns an in-service teacher who used  mobile phones in her class, the second case study involves a pre-service teacher who collaborated with the in-service teacher to teach mathematics lessons using mobile phones, and the third case study is about 15 pre-service teachers who were observers of the experiment but did not use  mobile phones in their teaching. We held one-hour semi-structured interviews with the in-service teacher, with the leading pre-service teacher and with the group of other observer pre-service teachers. This happened three times during the academic year: at the beginning of the experiment, after three months and after it ended. The research findings indicate that different factors have an impact on the attitudes and decisions of the teacher:   history of the teacher using technologies in teaching,   perceptions of the teacher using technologies in teaching, communitys teacher, rules regulating the use of technologies in teaching mathematics, and division of labor.  For example, questions as to who decides which technologies to use in the classroom and who should prepare the learning material for the students. Contradictions were identified in mathematics teachers' activity when utilizing mobile phones in their teaching. These contradictions hinder or slow such utilization. Community, especially its leading members, mediated and helped overcome the activity contradictions that arose throughout the experiment regarding the teaching processes in and/or out of the mathematics classroom."

How to actually capture and exploit context, however, is not self-evident and it is tempting to assign the related responsibilities to individual context-consuming applications. Unfortunately, this confuses the user, complicates application development and hinders context-aware semantic computing as a research discipline. In this article, we outline context-aware semantic computing research topics and the state-of-the-art mobile application development frameworks of special interest to us, acknowledging best practices for accessing and modeling sensor context. From the integrated point of view, context-aware semantic computing is demonstrated in terms of a software component called context engine. In order to better understand how theory is tied with practice, we also introduce a simple context engine prototype. Finally, we use the research background and the empirical setting to discuss the significant problems and relevant research directions in context-aware semantic processing."

However, would smartphones and MCDSS also be useful for medical students during their clinical clerkships? In this prospective pilot study eight students were asked to use a smartphone during their daily clerkship activities and specifically to evaluate a basic MCDSS. Students were asked to fill out a short survey and exit interviews were conducted. Most students found the smartphone, especially access to the internet, a useful tool during their clerkship. Some students thought that the internet was an easier accessible information source compared to many applications. Several students were not aware of any high-quality applications and most students were not willing to pay more than ten Euros for such an application. In the opinion of most students smartphones should not be used in the presence of a patient. Students expressed a desire for more basic content in the tested MCDSS. In conclusion, smartphones can be a useful tool for medical students during their clerkship. MCDSS for medical students should be designed to their needs.

A typical way of interacting with SNSs is to access them when the user has a suitable situation to check the status of her social networks or to write an update. One way to enhance the usage of SNSs is to have the service automatically push notifications about events to the smartphone user interface. However, there is no research on how users experience such SNS notifications. We present an explorative field study with 11 participants to assess how users experience mobile notifications compared to reading SNS content manually, initiated by the user. The participants first used Facebook for a month without notifications and then for a month with an application called Socially that sends frequent notifications about Facebook events to the userâ??s smartphone desktop. The participants who kept the notification feature on reported increased reading of Facebook. However, after a while, many were unwilling to receive the notifications, mainly because of lack of control. We report the qualitative findings on user experience, which reveal for example, that the use of mobile notifications decreases interest in Facebook. Notifications limit user control, and using Facebook feels more meaningful when accessed manually. Implications for design are discussed."

Proposed Multihoming and Route Optimization for MANEMO (MROM) scheme is designed to provide Route Optimization (RO) and Multihomed in NEMO architectures. This paper proposes two novel schemes; MANEMO routing scheme and Multihoming-based scheme. These are to provide support for next generation networks. The proposed MROM scheme differs from other schemes for NEMO environment because it considers the requirements of more application flows parameters as packet lost delivery, handoff delay as well as throughput). Another difference is that not only the network infrastructure can begin the functionality of flow routing, but also an Edge Mobile Router (EMR) can do this flow for routing. Moreover, it utilizes the state of the art and presently active access network to perform the separation of each flow in mobile network. Thus, proposed MROM exhibits multihoming features and improves handoff performance by initiating flow-based fast registration process in NEMO environment. A handoff method is proposed with enhanced functionalities of the Local Mobility Anchors (LMA), Mobile Routers (MRs) and signaling messages with a view to achieve continuous connectivity through handoff in NEMO. Both analytical and simulation approaches are used. Analytical evaluation is carried out to analyze packet delivery lost and handoff delay of our proposed scheme. It was also shown that cost of signaling messages and packet delivery are contributing to total handoff cost. At the simulation part, network simulator 3 (NS 3) has been used as the tool to get performance metrics that have been considered like packet delivery ratio, handoff delay, and packet loss. Our proposed scheme (MROM) has been benchmarking to the standard NEMO BS Protocol and P-NEMO. In this paper, we discuss proposed MROM for next generation networks, providing detailed analysis with a numerical model, proposed MROM, by maximizing the handoff performance, has been justified to have better mobility support than the ordinary NEMO BS Protocol and PNEMO."

Yet, they might face fear of failure or fear of facing examiners during thevivasession.A viva session has been noted to be mysterious, unpredictable, and potentially frightening to somestudents, particularly to students whose English is their second language.Some of these students might consider themselves to have  low ability in expressing their words thus lacking in confidence to facean oral assessment.These students, however, can prepare well for a viva session by rereading their thesis, arranging for a mockviva, and practicing debating their work with a senior student. This paper attempts to present a new way of viva preparation by means of a virtual viva simulator (V2Sim). This V2Sim is based on a virtual reality approach that usesan avatar as an examiner. This study aims to design and developa V2Sim to providearepeatablecoaching for a viva session at no cost. The implementation ofthe V2Sim involved three phases: identification of research problem, design and development, and evaluation. The study aspires to examine the experience of postgraduate students using the new technique. For this purpose, a combination of interviews and an experimental method were adopted to evaluate the V2Sim coachingamong 30 PhD students. Interpretive outcomes from this study suggest that the V2Sim coachingis a novel tool for assessing learning outcomes for a viva voce session and for improving students skills. Based on these findings, implications for the adoption of V2Sim coachingas an assessment method are discussed, among which the improvement of the experience of viva-voce session in the future."

Although, when considering the populace of the visitors to these sites, the hearing impaired (HI) visitors which made up of a smaller percentage, have not been in the literature limelight as much as the normal hearing visitors. Thus, the hearing impaired tends to endure certain unpalatable experiences leading to dissatisfaction of their visits. Literature has shown that Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) can improve the experiences of visitors to the museum in terms of engagement, enjoyment and learning. This is evident in a number of articles tailored towards normal hearing visitors. However, a recent study has taken into consideration the hearing impaired visitors by identifying the engagement elements of MAR for the HI museum visitors. The identified elements include; aesthetics, interaction, interest, usability, satisfaction, motivation, curiosity, enjoyment, perceived control, self-efficacy, and focused attention. This article thus takes a step further by introducing the MAR for the HI museum visitors engagement (MARHIME) conceptual model. These elements are derived from a review of literature which has been done comprehensively and are validated by a panel of experts. Altogether eleven elements went through the expert review process and only six elements were validated to be used for the construction of the MARHIME model. This article also further grounds the justification of these selected six elements in relation to engagement. Future work will include the development of the MARHIME prototype which will be used to validate the model among the hearing impaired visitors at a museum."

But enterprises also need to rely on their legacy systems, which are of vital importance to them and normally difficult to reconfigure or modify, their mere replacement being usually not affordable. These systems constitute, therefore, barriers to agility and competitiveness, raising the need to develop cost-effective ways for IoT adaptation. An approach for adapting legacy manufacturing systems into the IoT realm is proposed in this research. The methodology is twofold: an adaptation board is firstly designed to provide IoT connectivity, allowing to remotely invoke the “legacy” functionality as services. Then, the board itself can leverage the legacy system by developing additional functionalities inside it, as the update process is usually triggered by the need of new functionality from these systems. An experiment, which consists of adapting to IoT a small distribution line that is controlled by an aged Programmable Logic Controller, is developed to illustrate how straightforward, affordable and cost effective the adaptation approach is, allowing to holistically achieve a new system with more sophisticated functionality.,"

Using the measured data of fuel consumption and the main variables related to the vehicle displacement, it is possible to make corrections to the influence of the main disturbing factors and clearly improve the quality of road tests based evaluations. Thus, the fuel consumption rate is continuously recorded during the motion of the vehicle, whereas the power required to ensure displacement can be calculated using a simulation model with the data recorded during a path. Integrating over time the average power values at each interval, the energy necessary to ensure the vehicle displacement is calculated, while integrating the fuel rate over the duration of the path, the fuel consumption is computed. The ratio between the theoretically required energy and the one actually spent provides the conversion efficiency of the vehicle propulsion system. The developed tool is very useful in the framework of the courses about car dynamics included in Mechanical or Automotive Engineering Programmes. The developed tool couples data collected during road tests with a simulation model that computes all the force components acting on the car body during the motion. It has been written in LabView and an attractive graphical interface is used to keep the attention of the students when the data is displayed in real-time or analysed based upon previously recorded files.,"

Such applications can change their behavior according to context or perform specific tasks in specific contexts. Regardless of the application, all context-aware mobile applications share the need to retrieve and process context information. This paper presents a Context Management tool for the Android platform (ACM). ACM allows easy access to internal on-board mobile sensors and hardware features extracting corresponding raw data. Raw context is processed into higher-level more human-readable context that is provided seamlessly to the mobile applications. Different methods are used for this purpose including fuzzy classifiers. Since different mobiles have different sensors and hardware features, ACM can adapt to the mobile device by deactivating access to unavailable ones. Information regarding the available sensors and hardware features and their specifications can also be queried. Additionally, applications can request notifications regarding context change or specific context values. In addition to providing developers with supporting classes and methods, ACM is accompanied by an application that allows developers to examine its functionality and capabilities before using it. The application can be also used to examine the readings of the different sensors in different situations and thus calibrate them as needed. Additionally, it can be used to modify and personalize default interpretations of raw context values to high-level ones.

As a result, the need to come up with new techniques for securing data and accommodating the growing quantities of information is crucial. From nature to science, the idea that genes themselves are made of information stimulated the research in molecular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is capable of storing huge amounts of data, which leads to its promising effect in steganography. DNA steganography is the art of using DNA as an information carrier which achieves high data storage capacity as well as high security level. Currently, DNA steganography techniques utilize the properties of only one DNA strand, since the other strand is completely dependent on the first one. This paper presents a DNA-based steganography technique that hides data into both DNA strands with respect to the dependency between the two strands. In the proposed technique, a key of the same length of the reference DNA sequence is generated after using the second DNA strand. The sender sends both the encrypted DNA message and its reference DNA sequence together into a microdot. If the recipient receives this microdot uncontaminated, the sender can safely send the generated key afterwards. The proposed technique doubles the amount of data stored and guarantees a secure transmission process as well, for even if the attacker suspects the first-sent DNA sequence, they will never receive the key, and hence full data extraction is nearly impossible. The conducted experimental study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed."

SA is a topic of text mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and web mining disciplines. Research in SA is currently at its peak given the amount of data generated from social media networks. The concept is that consumers are expressing exactly what they need, want and expect from a product but on the other hand the companies dont have the tools to analyse and understand these feelings to satisfy these consumers accordingly. One of the applications that generate a high rate of reactions and sentiments in social networks is Instagram. This study focuses on analysing the reactions generated by the top 50 fashion houses on Instagram given their top 20 images with the highest number of likes. The approach taken in this study is to qualify the visual aesthetics of fashion images and to establish why some succeed on social media more than others. The basic question asked in this paper is whether there are certain visual aesthetics that appeal more to the user and are therefore more successful on social media than others as determined by a measure we introduce, ‘Social Value. To do so, a sentiment analysis tool is developed to measure the proposed social value of each image. An input of comments from each image will be processed. Each comment will go through a pre-processing phase; each word will be placed through a lexicon to identify if it is positive or negative. The output of the lexicon is a score value assigned to each comment to identify its degree of positivity, negativity, or it has no effect on the social value. Adding to these results, the number of likes and shares would also be taken into consideration quantifying the images value.

The 4Vs of big data – volume, velocity, variety and veracity makes the data management and analytics challenging for the traditional data warehouses. It is important to think of big data and analytics together. Big data is the term used to describe the recent explosion of different types of data from disparate sources. Analytics is about examining data to derive interesting and relevant trends and patterns, which can be used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and even drive new business models. Cloud computing seems to be a perfect vehicle for hosting big data workloads. However, working on big data in the cloud brings its own challenge of reconciling two contradictory design principles. Cloud computing is based on the concepts of consolidation and resource pooling, but big data systems (such as Hadoop) are built on the shared nothing principle, where each node is independent and selfsufficient. The integrating big data with cloud computing technologies, businesses and education institutes can have a better direction to the future. The capability to store large amounts of data in different forms and process it all at very large speeds will result in data that can guide businesses and education institutes in developing fast. Nevertheless, there is a large concern regarding privacy and security issues when moving to the cloud which is the main causes as to why businesses and educational institutes will not move to the cloud. This paper introduces the characteristics, trends and challenges of big data. In addition to that, it investigates the benefits and the risks that may rise out of the integration between big data and cloud computing."
591,A Modified Cloud-Based Cryptographic Agent for Cloud Data Integrity,",cloud data storage and processing security, document key print, homomorphic encryption, QR Codes,","2017-04-11,","In spite of all the advantages delivered by cloud computing, several challenges are hindering the migration of customer software and data into the cloud. On top of the list is the security and privacy concerns arising from the storage and processing of sensitive data on remote machines that are not owned, or even managed by the customers themselves. In this paper, initially a homomorphic encryption-based Cryptographic Agent is proposed. The proposed Cryptographic Agent is based on Paillier scheme, and is supported by user-configurable software protection and data privacy categorization agents, as well as set of accountable auditing services required to achieve legal compliance and certification. This scheme was tested using different text documents with different sizes. Testing results showed that as the size of the document increases, the size of the generated key increases dramatically causing a major problem in regards to the processing time and the file size especially for large documents. This leaded us to the second part of this research which is: a modified security architecture that adds two major autonomic security detective agents to the multi-agent architecture of cloud data storage. In this paper, we focus on the first agent namely (Automated Master Agent, AMA) that is added to the Multi Agent System Architecture (MASA) layer (cloud client-side) by which any changes happen in the document are mapped in a QR code encoded key print (KP). Experimental results after integrating these agents showed a 100% alternation detection accuracy and a superiority in extracting the KP of large and very large size documents which exceeds the currently available products and leverage the tamper-proof capabilities of cryptographic coprocessors to establish a secure execution domain in the computing cloud that is physically and logically protected from unauthorized access."

In order to facilitate communication in MANET, every node has to participate in the routing process. Finding an optimal route is a fundamental task in MANET, where routes tend to be multi-hoped and susceptible. Several routing protocols exist and can be classified as; topology-based and position-based routing protocols. However, the efficiency of these protocols in highly dynamic and dense environments is a challenging task to be considered for increasing perceived Quality of Service (QoS) in MANET. This paper focuses on the presentation and basic operation of each category. A qualitative evaluation between both categories is conducted to achieve a performance comparison in terms of packet- delivery ratio, End-to End delay and routing overhead. Results show that position-based overcome topology-based routing protocols in high dynamic and sparse environments. Recommendations for designing and implementing efficient position-based protocols are presented."

Moreover, MANETs considered as an infrastructure less network, so the cost of this type of networks is less in comparison to other traditional networks. On the other hand, the routing considered one of most important challenges in MANETs due to the  perpetual motion and randomness of the nodes that can causing a continuous change of the network topology and thus to all paths between nodes, where finding valid paths between the nodes is the core task of routing protocols. Recently, it has been argued that the traditional layered architecture is ineffective to deal with receiving signal strength related problems. In an effort to improve the performance of MANETs, there has been increased in protocols that rely on cross-layer interaction between different layers. In this paper, a Cross-layer design among Network, MAC and Physical layers based on Threshold Multipath Routing Protocol (CTMRP) is proposed. The CTMRP is designed for decision maker based on threshold value of average paths signal for efficient transmission of the Text, image, audio and video as well as sending the data via multiple paths, which mitigate the negatives effects causes from forcing the nodes to send the data via single. The Route Discovery Delay, Number of RREQ Messages, Number of RREP Messages, End-to-End Delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and Throughput were selected as the main performance evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance and lead to increase stability of transmission link.,"

Differing views on the format (e-book or print) that students prefer for academic purposes to improve their educational experience exist of which most studies have been done in developed countries. Therefore, a research that reveals students perceptions and preferences towards the two book formats in the nation of South Africa can afford a better understanding and conclusion on an African student. This study aimed to determine students preference on using e-books and print books in meeting academic information needs based on perceptions. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and a questionnaire as a research instrument which was administered to students at the University of Fort Hare. Findings revealed that students preferred using both (e-books and print books) for their academic needs. Moreover, they perceived e-books to be as good as print books, easy and friendly to use and capable of providing sufficient information to meet educational needs. ,"

683,Towards a New Scalable Big Data System Semantic Web Applied on Mobile Learning,",Mobile Learning, Semantic Web, e-learning, Big Data, RDF,","2020-01-20,","In Web 3.0, semantic data gives machines the ability to understand and process data. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is the liagna franca of Semantic Web. While Big Data handles the problematic of storing and processing massive data, it still does not provide a support for RDF data. In this paper, we present a new Big Data semantic web comprised of a classical Big Data system with a semantic layer. As a proof of concept of our approach, we use Mobile-learning as a case study. The architecture we propose is composed of two main parts: a knowledge server and an adaptation model. The knowledge server allows trainers and business experts to represent their expertise using business rules and ontology to ensure heterogeneous knowledge. Then, in a mobility environment, the knowledge server makes it possible to take into account the constraints of the environment and the user constraints thanks to the RDF exchange format. The adaptation model based on RDF graphs corresponds to combinatorial optimization algorithms, whose objective is to propose to the learner a relevant combination of Learning Object based on its contextual constraints. Our solution guarantees scalability, and high data availability through the use of the principle of replication. The results obtained in the system evaluation experiments, on a large number of servers show the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our system if the amount of data processed is very large."

Teaching on the other hand has also evolved involving more flexibility in tasks and learning stages, thus using modern technologies that offer more alternatives now. In addition, such tasks may be specific to the learning content as well as the learning context or furthermore the learner's environment.Traditionally, mobile platform design relies on the skills of a mobile developer whose knowledge allows him to design mobile applications that are useful to users. But with mobile learning, the design phase involves more than just mobile development skills. For example, if you are designing a platform for practical work, the instructors responsible for the training should be involved. However, the empirical results show that educators do not integrate technology effectively into their curricula. To enable these instructors to develop mobile learning platforms, it is important to facilitate their integration through a theoretical model that will take into account all the ingredients necessary to complete this learning and to balance them in order to ensure its efficiency.

Based on location host IP addresses, TCP-IP designed for Peer-to-Peer communication P2P. NDN architecture is oriented Content Centric Networking CCN, where the data is stored on routers and distributed to users from the nearest router.  Cache capacities of routers are limited compared to forwarded contents. To move from TCP-IP model to CCN model, many papers propose several new contents distribution based architecture ICN. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to optimize the use of network resources inspired from Network clustering and cluster head selection in MANETs. Specifically, the improved K-medoids cluster algorithm is used to divide the global network in clusters, where for each cluster; three routers are selected as content routers. The first is the main caching router as well as the second and the third are the secondary caching router. The caching router selection process relies on three relevant criteria consisting of the distance between a node and its cluster centroid, the number of neighbors, and the congestion level. Two Multi Attribute Decision–Making methods MADM are applied, namely TOPSIS and AHP.

752,Improved Direct Routing Approach for Mobile IP Systems,",Mobile IP, Routing, Care of address, Home Agent, Foreign Agent,","2019-08-02,","The mobile IP communication protocol is a flexible system for mobile connection that is designed to allow the device to be moved between networks while maintaining a permanent IP address. IP datagrams using mobile IP can be routed to a specific mobile station (MS) regardless of its current internet location. However, to facilitate such routable characteristics, the communication with an MS that is visiting a foreign network is intermediate with communication between the home agent (HA) and the foreign agent (FA) which increase the total delay and harms the communication performance, especially when the MS continuously moves from a network to another. Accordingly, to handle the delay issue, this paper proposes a new approach for mobile IP direct routing, based on the “follow-me” principle. The proposed approach depends on sending a new temporary care-of-address (CoA) for the previously visited network as the MS moves to another to keep a reliable tracking–like process with the HA. Accordingly, the agents of all the visited networks play the same principles as the HA role whenever the MS moves from a network to another. The proposed approach influences the delay and the speed of the delivery of internet packets. The simulation showed that the proposed method decreases the delay by up to 50% compared to the direct routing approach. ,"

781,Analysis and Ideas for Improved Routing in MANET,",MANET, Selfish nodes, Fading, Throughput, Alternate route, Helper nodes,","2019-04-10,","Mobile Ad hoc NETwork is a collection of mobile nodes connected with each other without any centralized infrastructure support. In MANET, every node acts as a router, thereby forwards the packet to other nodes through the best route possible. The cooperation of all other nodes is very essential for a node to transfer data to its desired destination. Throughput is a major factor that determines the health of any network including MANET and there can be many reasons that can disrupt the throughput. In this paper we deal with two prime reasons that may reduce the throughput in a MANET. The first reason is that, if a node behaves selfishly and utilizes the path only for forwarding its own packet, then the packets from other nodes will be dropped and the throughput will gradually get reduced. The second reason for reduction in throughput is the phenomenon called fading, which causes signal attenuation. This phenomenon creates path loss temporarily, during which the packet loss increases and the throughput takes a major hit. Removing such nodes from the network on the basis of doubt about its packet forwarding nature and ability will eventually weaken the network strength. Neglecting the original best route will also reduce the quality of the network. Both the cases of selfishness and fading can be normalized by switching over to an alternate path and coming back to the same route after a short period of time. Thereby the quality as well as the quantity of nodes involved in the network can be maintained. In this paper we have also introduced an innovation called helper nodes which will also help in the formation of alternate path and will very well neutralize the ill effects caused due to selfishness and fading."

However, medicine has a problem in visualizing patients through looking through multiple slices of scans, trying to understand the three-dimensional (3D) anatomical structure of patients. With Mixed Reality (MR) the developments in medicine visualization will become much easier and creates a better environment for surgeries. This will help reduce the excessive effort and time spent by surgeons to locate where the problem lies with patients without looking through multiple of two-dimensional (2D) slices, but to see patients bodies in 3D in front of them augmented in their reality, and to interact with it whatever pleases them. Moreover, this will reduce the number of scans that doctors will ask their patients for, which will result in less harmful x-ray dosages for both the patient and the radiologist. Biomedical development in medical visualization is an active research topic as it provides the physicians with required devices for clinically feasible way for diagnosis, follow-up and take decisions in different disease life line. Current clinical imaging facility can provide a 3D imaging that can be used to guide different interventional procedures. The main challenge is how to map the information presented in the digital image with the real object. This is commonly implemented by mental processing that requires skills from the medical doctor. This paper contributes to this problem by providing a mixed reality system to merge the digital image of the patient anatomy with the patient visual image. Anatomical image obtained from Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is mapped over the patient body using virtual reality (VR) head-mounted device (HMD).,"

In a mobile object monitoring systems, balancing computing resources and quality of privacy is required.  Objects can be mobile devices or users or any other moving entity. This work is presented in wireless sensor network environment. Earlier work does not consider presence of mobile objects in 3D space. We can observe that objects also carry Z axis in city area where high rise buildings are present.  Earlier monitoring applications are mainly designed in two dimensional space to protect privacy. Our novelty is to suggest and design mechanism that reflect Z position (height) of mobile objects for protecting privacy. While calculating cloaking area and counting of objects, height is also considered as third dimension. This results in better location privacy as compared to the privacy delivered by the scheme that considers two dimensional space.

The purpose of such touch interfaces is to run an application by touching a screen with a users finger or to implement various functions on the device. When the user has an attempt to use the touch interface, users tend to grab the mobile device with one hand. Because of the existence of untouchable areas to which the user cannot reach with the users fingers, it is possible to occur for a case where the user is not able to touch a specific area on the screen accurately. This results in some issues that the mobile device does not carry out the users desired function and the execution time is delayed due to the wrong implementation. Therefore, there is a need to distinguish the area where the user can stably input the touch interface from the area where the users cannot and to overcome the problems of the unstable touch area. Furthermore, when the size of the screen increases, these issues will become more serious because of an increase in the unstable touch areas. Especially, an interface that receives position and force data like 3D-touch requires the stable area setting different from the conventional 2D-touch. In this paper, we search and analyze the stable touch areas on the large screen where the user can do 3D-touch inputs.,"

In our opinion, the best solution to make transmission line courses more attractive is to offer practical applications and intensively use of mathematical computer-aided teaching tools to overcome, at the beginning, the difficulties linked to the theory. Indeed, transmission line theory comes alive when the travelling waves are animated on a screen (smartphone, tablets, laptop, etc.). Fundamental concepts such as “progressive wave”, “reflected wave” and “load matching” could be easily demonstrated in the classroom or at home. Transmission line simulations are applied to problems using connections to shunt, open, matched and unmatched loads, and show how the signal waveforms arise from one end to another. The proposed Android-based animations are used with a sinusoidal generator to illustrate the evolution to the sinusoidal steady state and allow learners to easily handle the corresponding Smith chart. Students are encouraged to run those applications at home as a computational laboratory to verify their solutions to homework problems. This article introduces simple Android-based virtual tools for the investigation and visualization in real time of waves traveling along a terminated finite-length transmission line, without and with faults between the source and the load. The package can be used as an educational tool in various lectures or homework to aid teaching high frequency electronics and transmission lines theory.,"

The behavior of networks becomes unstable once the first node dies. The key challenge in such networks is how to reduce energy consumption to increase the network lifetime, especially with the different amount of energy in heterogeneity environments.In this paper, the virtual backbone routing solution is suggested to reduce energy consumption in a wireless sensor network. An integrated approach combines both advantages of hierarchical cluster-based architecture and shortest spanning tree topology for constructing a virtual backbone with a mobile sink. The clustering solution is used to divide the network into clusters and reduces the number of nodes included in the communication. On the other hand, the shortest spanning tree technique is used to construct a backbone among all cluster heads and mobile sink every time the sink traverses to a new location. The proposed approach aims to construct an efficient data aggregation spanning tree used to send or receive data between the mobile sink and elected cluster heads in wireless sensor networks. It constructs an efficient virtual backbone to decrease the energy consumption and prolong the lifetime of the network.,Performance evaluation results demonstrate how the proposed approach prolongs the lifetime of wireless sensor networks compared to some conventional clustering protocols."

Recently, several user identification techniques being proposed for DCN. Unfortunately, the existing proposals cannot maintain user anonymity when the majority of probable attacks. In addition, the further time synchronization mechanism they use can result in widespread overhead costs. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized service access for a mobile device in distributed networks. The mechanism implements methods to generate securely encrypted keys using RSA algorithm to validate the authentication of user login id and password.  Later, it implements a secure session key generation using DH algorithm which allows accessing the different services without repeating the authentication mechanism. An experimental evaluation was performed to measure execution time overhead for the registration process, an authentication process, session key generation process and Service Request Performance. The comparison results with existing authentication mechanism show an improvisation in all the measures."

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) belong to the class of these networks, in which each vehicle participates in routing by transmitting data for other nodes (vehicles). Due to the characteristics of VANET (e.g. high dynamic topology, different communication environment, frequently link breakage…), the routing process still one of the most challenging aspects. Hence, many routing protocols have been suggested to overcome these challenges. Moreover, routing protocols based on the position of vehicles are the most popular and preferred class, thanks to its many advantages like the less control overhead and the scalability. However, this class suffer from some problems such as frequent link breakages caused by the high-mobility of vehicles, which cause a low PDR and throughput. In this investigation, we introduce a novel greedy forwarding strategy used to create a new routing protocol based on the position of vehicles, to reduce the link breakages and get a stable route that improves the PDR and throughput. The proposed Density and Velocity (Speed, Direction) Aware Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing protocol (DVA-GPSR) is based on the suggested greedy forwarding technique that utilizes the density, the speed and the direction for selecting the most convenient relaying node candidate. The results of simulation prove that DVA-GPSR protocol outperforms the classical GPSR in all studied metrics like PDR, throughput, and the ratio of routing overhead by changing the quantity of vehicles in urban and highway scenarios."

926,Applying Machine Learning for Automatic User Story Categorization in Mobile Enterprises Application Development,",Mobile enterprise applications, Text classification, User stories,","2020-09-11,","Mobile enterprise applications (apps) are developed in dynamic and complex environments. Hardware characteristics, operating systems and development tools are constantly changing. In larger institutions, comprehensive corporate guidelines and requirements have to be followed. In addition, larger enterprises often develop numerous apps and lack an overview of development projects. Because of the size of such companies, a comprehensive direct information exchange between developers is often not practicable. In this situation, IT support is necessary, for example to prevent unnecessary duplication of work in the development of software artifacts such as user stories, app screen designs or code features within the company. One approach to overcome these challenges is to support reusing results from previous projects by building systems to organize and analyse the knowledge base of enterprise app development projects. For such systems an automatic categorization of artifacts is required. In this work we propose using a machine learning approach to categorize user stories. The approach is evaluated on a set of user stories from real-world mobile enterprise application development projects. The results are promising and suggest that machine learning approaches can be beneficially applied to user story classification in large companies.,"

However, this development still presents many challenges, such as determining the best route between sources and destinations, especially taking into account the use of the medium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers of IEEE 802.11n/ac. Some papers have proposed rate adaptation algorithms particularly for single-hop networks; however, these only focused on mechanisms to find data rates suitable for channel conditions. In IEEE 802.11s WMNs, the design of the rate adaptation algorithm is more challenging. Besides considering the problem of channel quality and optimal throughput, it is necessary to also consider the problem of collision and the best route. It is important to take collision into account because the collision probability in multi-hop mesh networks is higher than that in single-hop networks and can lead to a lower throughput. Rate adaptation algorithms for IEEE 802.11s WMNs have been proposed in other papers, but they also do not consider the use of the MAC and PHY layers of IEEE 802.11n/ac. In this paper, we propose the collision-aware rate adaptation for optimal high-throughput (CARA-OHT) algorithm for WMN IEEE 802.11s. An evaluation through the extensive use of a network NS-3 simulator shows that the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher throughput than previously developed algorithms."

Nevertheless, due to its special characteristics like high mobility, large size of the network and dynamic topology make routing of data in the vehicular ad hoc network more challenging. The problem in these networks is to determine the routing protocol best suited to this environment, and then secure it to provide optimal and secure routing for the data. Recently, position-based routing protocol has been developed by researchers to be a very interesting routing technique for communication between vehicles. In this paper, we propose an secured and enhanced version of the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol. This protocol consists of two modules: (i) To implement an improvement of GPSR routing protocol which minimizes transfer delays and control messages. (ii) To deal with security issues, we have proposed a solution that combines between an improved Diffie-Hellman algorithm for reliable key exchange and the hash function based Message Authentication Code (MAC) for the verification of the authentication and integrity of GPSR packet. The proposed solution was checked by the security protocol verification tool, Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA), which indicated that it is a very secure level.

Each of these notifications can mean added value for smartphone users in terms of content, but also disruption and interruption. It is therefore important for advertisers to understand how the frequency of message delivery influences consumer acceptance. The systematic review is based on the PRISMA method and initially identifies a total of 18,725 potentially relevant scientific papers. The 17 research articles included in the qualitative synthesis show that push notifications are suitable for encouraging users to use an app and establish new habits. App usage increases with frequency, with particularly active users tolerating higher frequencies. At the same time it is also shown that too high a frequency can be perceived as disturbing and users should therefore be given the opportunity to determine the frequency with which they receive notifications. A gap in research has been identified in particular in studies that look at real observed behaviour of app users instead of behaviour reported via questionnaires and examine the interaction of frequency, content and presentation of notifications."

The five-stage framework includes (1) vision internalization, (2) persistence propagation, (3) new technology adaptation, (4) extending collaboration, and (5) outcome integration. The vision internalization stage produces a better understanding of the big picture and systematic approach required, including the division of experiments to research attendance. The experience is then brought to Research Methodology and Research Design classes. In the second stage, persistence propagation may be better translated to relentlessly solving the problem and to increase the laboratory power. The persistence propagation also includes providing fail-safe and verification procedures of possibly dubious results produced in the laboratory. In the end, it may improve operating procedures or methods in a laboratory manual. The movement of open hardware makes it possible for faster technology adaptation to food-laboratory. For example, measuring functional food material drying kinetics is now quickly adopted as a result of recent IoT technology. In a later stage, IoT is integrated into the closest courses, i.e., Introduction to Computer or Programming in Food Technology. The research may reach a milestone that requires expansion and sophisticated equipment beyond the capacity of the laboratory. Therefore, collaboration is needed between laboratories within the university or greater. Students are prepared to conduct functional food research in partner laboratories; hence, the requisite bench skills are better taught. The last stage happens when new and related knowledge is accumulated, i.e., umbrella research in functional food produces several publications and theses. Researchers may visit and align the current curriculum in the subject of Functional Food Technology. In summary, the horizontal integration with an emphasize on IoT Technology results in a unique set of research-teaching excellence framework that is incrementally developed."

Therefore, the problems of optimal control of the communication networks are relevant. For example, there are  users, and no more than a demand of one user can be served simultaneously. This paper considers a discrete dynamical system with two contours and two common points of the contours called the . There are  cells and  particles, located in the cells. At any discrete moment the particles of each contour occupy neighboring cells and form a cluster. The nodes divide each contour into two parts of length  and  (non-symmetrical system). The particles move in accordance with rule of the elementary cellular automaton 240 in the Wolfram classification. Delays in the particle movement are due to that more than one particle cannot move through the node simultaneously. A competition (conflict) occurs when two clusters come to the same node simultaneously. We have proved that the spectrum of velocities contains no more than two values for any fixed  and .  We have found an optimal rule which minimizes the average velocity of clusters. One of the competition clusters passes through the node first in accordance with a given competition rule. Two competition resolutions rules are introduced. The rules are called input priority and output priority resolution rules. These rules are Markovian, i.e., they takes into account only the present state of the system.  For each set of parameters  and  one of these two rules is optimal, i.e., this rule maximizes the average velocity of clusters. These rules are compared with the left-priority resolution rule, which was considered earlier.  We have proved that the spectrum of velocities contains no more two values for any fixed  and .

The proposed solution attempts to optimize the Googles Map API request flow using open street map (OSM). As it is known that each request to Google Map API will incur some latency, since different computation are performed on Google server for each request. To avoid this latency, route estimations (distance and time) are calculated using a four-pronged approach based on Google map API, open street map (OSM), routing cache and logical grid of locations. The objective is to create a generalized routing system that tries to use Google services in optimized fashion. The proposed approach stores each requests/ response from Google Map API into an optimized data structure called cache. After passage of time, these cache records are moved to another data structure called random access memory (RAM) file. In scenarios where requests cant be served via stored data, the proposed system attempts to give approximate estimations based on open street map (OSM) using an A* search for finding route. In addition to this, data that has been cached in proposed approach can be used for further analysis or applying machine learning algorithm for off-line route calculations later."

The dynamic nature of MANET and the limited capabilities of wireless nodes in terms of memory size and battery charge are the most important obstacles to the routing (path-finding) process between nodes. In this research, we introduced a new protocol based on the well-known DSR protocol to add a mechanism that controls the RREQ Flooding process, which aims to reach more stable (life-long) routes while reducing the overhead of routing process caused by link breakage between nodes and reduce the overhead of network flooding with RREQ messages with each attempt to find a path. In this proposed mechanism, a specific group is selected from within the devices adjacent to the transmitter to be sent RREQ so that these devices are selected based on the stability evaluation criterion. The stability criterion is calculated based on three weighted factors: the speed of the node, the out-degree value (the number of adjacent nodes), and the number of tracks stored in the device memory. The proportion of devices selected is automatically changed adaptively to ensure that the expected throughput of this network is achieved. The proposed protocol was tested using simulation where results showed that ASDSR proved an enhancement in route stability about (0.13), and a decrease in the number of deleted routes by (9%), while maintaining the expected packet delivery ratio of the original DSR by about (0.86).,"

1099,An Effectual Secured Approach Against Sybil Attacks in Wireless Networks,",Network Security, Wireless Network Security, Security in Wireless Environment,","2022-05-10,","In both wireless and mobile ad hoc networks, assaults can come from a variety of different sources. The terms ""active attack"" and ""passive attack"" describe these two types of attacks. In the network community, the Sybil attack is one of the most often used and deployed techniques for sniffing identities and repurposing them. Multiple identities or Sybil attacks have recently sparked a lot of interest in the research community. The algorithms and networks on which they are tested are vastly different among the many methods that have been offered. Since researchers can't evaluate these systems side by side or test their efficacy on real-world social networks with a variety of structural features, it's difficult to say whether there are any other (perhaps more efficient) methods of Sybil protection. In the event of a Sybil attack, the gatecrasher subverts the system framework's notoriety arrangement by creating a large number of pseudonymous individuals and then using them to add an enormously imbalanced influence. Three factors determine a notoriety framework's susceptibility to a Sybil attack: how quickly personalities can be generated, how much the notoriety framework accepts inputs from substances that lack a chain of trust, and if the notoriety framework handles all components equally. A large-scale Sybil ambush in Bittorrent Mainline may be accomplished in a cheap and effective manner, according to confirmation. A substance on a distributed system is a piece of software that has access to the resources of the local community. By displaying a character, a distributed system element reveals itself to the world. A single chemical can have an impact on more than one character. Numerous characters can be assigned to a single element. The personalities of substances in shared systems are used for the objectives of repetition, asset transfer, reliability, and trustworthiness, among other reasons. For remote elements to be aware of characters without necessarily being aware of the personality-to-neighborhood correlation, distributed systems make use of the character as a decision. Each different identification is normally considered to be associated with a separate local entity by convention. A single local entity may have several identities in actuality. In order to avoid and identify Sybil assaults, an empirical technique is used in this study. According to the base paper, any nodes with RSS greater than the provided threshold are regarded to be attackers under the present approach. A centralized way to monitor the mobile nodes is required to prevent this assault. As the server agent assumes full control of the ad-hoc network, malevolent nodes or selfish nodes are fully eliminated from the system.,"

Different handwritten letter cuts in different font sizes are not equally readable on all screen types. The problem often occurs on extra small devices such as mobile phones. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the combination of the font type and appropriate font size that will ensure responsiveness and be readable on different devices, especially the small ones. For this purpose, a study of readability of monoline handwritten font in seven letter cuts (thin, ultra-light, light, regular, semi-bold, bold, and ultra-bold) in several font sizes was conducted. Variable font was used because it contains all style versions of one typeface family, as opposed to standard font families that use different files for each style version. Also, variable font is suitable for use on web because one file with all the necessary typeface styles is significantly smaller in size than classic families with multiple files which shortens the font loading time. Furthermore, model of readability evaluation using the fuzzy logic based postprocessing method for segmentation values related to evaluation criteria is proposed.

However, they still have challenging problems to research, such as the ergonomic and safety aspects. As an outcome, more research required its capabilities and a critical examination of the existing gestural interfaces and how they assist drivers' activities while driving. This research paper attempts to present a comprehensive understanding of possible gestures on the smartphones by conducting user testing with a sample data of 30 drivers from three different age groups. The user testing was performed in an actual driving environment. Observation and interviews were carried out to study drivers behavior while driving. The data gathered were then interpreted into action and motivation levels. The action level was defined by how drivers interact with smartphones while driving, and in motivation level, a study on why drivers interact in that manner was conducted. The results were then drawn to a table with the task carried out during user testing. In conclusion, this research aims to consider all these issues that drivers confront while driving. This is to determine how a more advanced gestural interaction of smartphone interfaces may be created to meet drivers' safety and ergonomic concerns.,"
1109,A Social Virtual Reality Mobile Application for Learning and Practicing English,",Virtual Reality, Mobile Learning, Social Networking, English Language Learning, Educational Technologies, Saudi Arabia, Covid-19, ,","2022-05-10,","Many studies promise that virtual reality (VR) applications will be one of the most used tools in foreign language learning. This is because VR keeps learners engaged, motivated, and prepared with better communication skills due to the simulation of real-life environments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing, it became difficult to use and practice newly learned language skills with real people directly. This paper proposes a social VR mobile application that can be used anytime anywhere to offer a set of different VR environments that simulate real-life situations in order to learn and practice the English language. The application aims to improve speaking skills by offering a private session with a native speaker tutor or a community of learners to practice speaking. It combines the benefits of mobile learning, social networks, and VR. Initial usability testing results showed that the application is simple and easy to use, with some problems discovered and resolved. The application demonstrates that applying VR tools could contribute positively to learning English among the language learners using it."

In order to address this menace, a cheating detection system has been proposed in this study. The system can detect cheating in real-time. The proposed system uses video surveillance to monitor the activities of the student during exams, especially abnormal behavior. The development of the system involved the use of three different techniques, with different functions. The first technique helps in determining the direction of the students heads when they move from their initial direction, which is the exam script. Some form of cheating involves students peeping at the exam scripts of other people writing the same exam. Whenever the system observes a deviation that exceeds the set threshold, it classifies the behavior as abnormal. The second technique works with the movement of the students iris. It detects when a students iris moves in a different direction to copy answers from written documents like mobile phones, books, hands, summary papers. The third technique is used in identifying the contact between a students hands and face, as well as that between different students for shared abnormal behavior detection between students, such as sharing of incriminating materials. When any of these is detected, an automatic alarm alerts the authority about the abnormal behavior that has been detected, thereby minimizing the error rate that can occur as a result of manual monitoring.,"

Still, numerous barriers exist while developing and implementing such kind of learning analytics applications. Machine learning algorithms emerge as useful tools to endorse learning analytics by building models capable of forecasting the final outcome of students based on their available attributes. The machine learning algorithms performance demotes with using the entire attributes and thus a vigilant selection of predicting attributes boosts the performance of the produced model. Though, several constructive techniques facilitate to identify the subset of productive attributes, however, the challenging task is to evaluate if the prediction attributes are meaningful, explicit, and controllable by the students. This paper reviews the existing literature to come up with the students attributes used in developing prediction models. We propose a conceptual framework which demonstrates the classification of attributes as either latent or dynamic. The latent attributes may appear significant but the student is not able to control these attribute, on the other hand, the student has command to restrain the dynamic attributes. Each of the major class is further categorized to present an opportunity to the researchers to pick constructive attributes for model development."

1134,A Study on the Impact of Nodes Density on the Energy Consumption of LoRa,",IoT, LoRa, LoRaWAN, energy efficiency, node density,","2021-07-28,","LoRaWAN is one of the leading Low power wide area network (LPWAN) LPWAN technologies that compete for the formation of big scale Internet of Things (IoT). It uses LoRa protocol to achieve long range, low bit rate and low power communication. Large scale LoRaWAN based IoT deployments can consist of battery powered sensor nodes. Therefore, the energy consumption and efficiency of these nodes are crucial factors that can influence the lifetime of the network. However, there is no coherent experimental based research which identifies the factors that influence the LoRa energy efficiency at various nodes density. In this paper, results on measuring the packet delivery ratio, packet loss, data rate and energy consumption ratio ECR to gauge the energy efficiency of LoRa devices at various nodes density are presented. It is shown that the ECR of LoRa is inversely proportional to the nodes density and that the ECR of the network is smaller at higher traffic indicating better network energy efficiency. It is also demonstrated that at high node density, spreading factor SF of 7 and 9 can improve the energy efficiency of the network by 5 and 3 times, respectively, compare to SF 11."
1135,Visual Emotion-Aware Cloud Localization User Experience Framework Based on Mobile Location Services,",Emotion Recognition, User Experience, Cloud Localization, Mobile Application, Location-Based Services.,","2021-07-28,","Recently, the study of emotional recognition models has increased in the human-computer interaction field. With high recognition accuracy of emotions data, we could get immediate feedback from mobile users, get a better perception of human behavior while interacting with mobile apps, and thus make the user experience design more adaptable and intelligent. The harnessing of emotional recognition in mobile apps can dramatically enhance users experience. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a visual emotion-aware cloud localization user experience framework based on mobile location services. An important feature of our proposed framework is to provide a personalized mobile app based on the users visual emotional changes. The framework captures the emotion-aware data, process them in the cloud server, and analyze them for an immediate localization process. The first stage in the framework builds a correlation between the applications default language and the users visual emotional feedback. In the second stage, the localization model loads the appropriate applications resources and adjusts the screen features based on the real-time users emotion obtained in the first stage and according to the location data that the app collected from the mobile device. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that our proposed framework can provide a high-quality application experience in terms of a users emotional levels and deliver an excellent level of usability that was before not possible.,"

Embedded technologies like IoT and Intelligent Transportation, are aimed to build smart networks for IoV to support diverse automated applications such as smart vehicle control, intelligent traffic control, and dynamic data services. However, in the smart domain, implementation of IoV has unresolved challenges. Synchronization of vehicles and humans is a crucial issue in making decisions. Therefore, proper understanding of the pertinent issues about IoV implementation that can improve the VNs performance are essential. DSRC and cellular networks are considered as potential alternatives for endorsing V2X communications. DSRC is employed for intelligent and automotive transportation applications through short-range data exchange between DSRC-components. Although spectrum assigned to DSRC alone will not be appropriate to satisfy huge information traffic needs for internet access in vehicles. Cellular networks offer potential solutions, attributing extensive range of cell coverage, broadly deployed infrastructure and greater capacity. Nevertheless, centralized characteristics of these networks limit the ability to handle low-latency communications that can challenge the efficacy of several safety applications. This paper reviews potential DSRC and wireless integrated solutions for efficient vehicular communications. In methodology, first we reviewed existing technologies that integrate DSRC with other wireless technologies and secondly, the study is carried out to highlight the limitations for each supporting vehicular communications. Thereby, the paper embeds a brief comparative analysis. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to integrate DSRC and 4G-LTE with a novel Optimal Clustering based Data Forwarding Protocol for efficient data transmission to attain better performance in IoV. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing approaches using the NS-3 simulation tool. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms over the existing approaches in terms of End to End Delay and throughput. ,"
1138,Violence Detection over Online Social Networks: An Arabic Sentiment Analysis Approach,",Violence Detection, Social Networks, Sentiment Analysis, Arabic Lexicon, Feature Extraction,","2021-07-28,","Today, the influence of the social media on different aspects of our lives is increasing, many scholars from various disciplines and majors looking at the social media networks as the ongoing revolution. In Social media networks, many bonds and connections can be established whether being direct or indirect ties. In fact, Social networks are used not only by people but also by companies. People usually create their own profiles and join communities to discuss different common issues that they have interest in. On the other hand, companies also can create their virtual presence on the social media networks to benefit from this media to understand the customers and gather richer information about them. With all of the benefits and advantages of social media networks, they should not always be seen as a safe place for communicating, sharing information and ideas, and establishing virtual communities. These information and ideas could carry with them hatred speeches that must be detected to avoid raising violence. Therefore, web content mining can be used to handle this issue. Web content mining is gaining more concern because of its importance for many businesses and institutions.  Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an important sub-area of web content mining.  The purpose of SA is to determine the overall sentiment attitude of writer towards a specific entity and classify these opinions automatically. There are two main approaches to build systems of sentiment analysis: the machine learning approach and the lexicon-based approach. This research presents the design and implementation for violence detection over social media using machine learning approach. Our system works on Jordanian Arabic dialect instead of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The data was collected from two popular social media websites (Facebook, Twitter) and has used native speakers to annotate the data. Moreover, different preprocessing techniques have been used to show their effect on our model accuracy. The Arabic lexicon was used for generating feature vectors and separate them to features set. Here, we have three well known machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Building on this view, Information Science Research Institutes (ISRI) stemming and stop word file as a result of preprocessing were used to extract the features. Indeed, several features have been extracted; however, using the SVM classifier reveals that unigram and features extracted from lexicon are characterized by the highest accuracy to detect violence.,"

Traffic accidents have many defects relating to increase number of death, infrastructure distribution, and health injuries; therefore, there is a crucial need to develop and modify an approach that utilizes the new technology to limit and prevent the traffic accidents.  Wireless sensors networks are developed to support smart solutions in smart cities like smart traffic, smart grid and others. In this research we developed a comprehensive approach to achieve the following three important goals in smart accident elimination. The first goal is to minimize the number of exchange information packets between sensors to save the battery life through developing and adapting clustering schema to minimize the number of exchanges information packets. The second goal is to calculate and determine the optimum route from accident location to the nearest rescue location by developing a dynamic routing schema   that is calculated by the control station depending on a cost heuristics function. The third goal is to predicate the accident causes and minimize the probability of accidents occur using a warning message schema and drawing some obstacles on some routing paths.

This traditional system requires the user to fill in their timesheets or sign on the attendance sheet manually. The practice inefficient and ineffective for universitys student attendance recording due to,  i) lecturer may lose the attendance sheet, ii) student may sign for their friends, iii) student may forget to sign on the attendance sheet, and iv) challenging to monitor attendance rate and analysis. Thus, there is a necessity to change these traditional attendance recording methods to a more efficient one. The attendance rate is significant because students are more likely to succeed in academics when they attend classes consistently. As such, a mobile app, namely Smart-Hadir, is designed to overcome problems as mentioned above. Smart-Hadir is a smartphone application developed by UMS aimed to record student attendance digitally during a class session. The technology used is slightly different from the existing applications, where Smart-Hadir is not using RFID technology but rather covers NFC, QR code, and beacon technologies. Attendance could be taken either using NFC or QR code displayed on the wall using a projector or scan the available beacon. Lecturers can create class session using the Smart-Hadir anywhere and anytime. Students are then required to take their attendance either scan the QR code, search the beacon, or swiped their student card on the lecturers phone. The students attendance will be immediately captured and saved into the database. Lecturers will be able to view the statistic report, identify and e-mail absentees, as well as monitor students attendance behaviour. A statistical report can be generated. It shows the percentages of students attendance rate, absent rate, and status. The Smart-Hadir is advantageous as it can be used to capture meeting or event attendance record as well."

Failure of a node affects both the lifetime and connectivity of a MANET, which has to initiate finding a new route from source to destination. This initiation causes more energy consumption in nodes. Failure of a node also causes network partitions, thereby resulting in sparse networks being formed. Existing energy-efficient strategies only defer the end of a nodes battery lifetime; they could not guarantee the MANETs nonstop functioning. To address the issues caused by battery depletion, this paper proposes a “Cloud” oriented approach called Power-as-a-Service (PaaS), a hierarchical on-demand charging model for recharging the mobile nodes of the MANET. In PaaS, the MANET is alienated into non-overlapping disjoint zones, and for each zone, one Zone Charging Cloud Node (ZccN) is deployed to recharge the mobile nodes of that particular zone wirelessly. A High-power Charging Cloud Node (HccN) is deployed to wirelessly recharge the ZccNs in the MANET for the entire network. In PaaS, the ZccN recharges both the selected node for recharge and other nodes around the selected node that requested recharge and has higher power transfer efficiency. This strategy of PaaS improves the charging efficiency of cloud chargers by minimizing the urgent charging requests in the future, and thus the operational efficiency of the MANET improves. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed PaaS model with a hierarchy of cloud chargers improves the operational efficiency of MANETs in terms of reducing the death rate of mobile nodes, thereby improving the lifetime and connectivity probability of MANETs."

1161,A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Interference Management in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks,",Heterogeneous Network, Q-Learning, Macrocell, Picocell, Interference,","2021-06-18,","Due to the increased demand for scarce wireless bandwidth, it has become insufficient to serve the network user equipment using macrocell base stations only. Network densification through the addition of low power nodes (picocell) to conventional high power nodes addresses the bandwidth dearth issue, but unfortunately introduces unwanted interference into the network which causes a reduction in throughput. This paper developed a reinforcement learning model that assisted in coordinating interference in a heterogeneous network comprising macro-cell and pico-cell base stations. The learning mechanism was derived based on Q-learning, which consisted of agent, state, action, and reward. The base station was modeled as the agent, while the state represented the condition of the user equipment in terms of Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio. The action was represented by the transmission power level and the reward was given in terms of throughput. Simulation results showed that the proposed Q-learning scheme improved the performances of average user equipment throughput in the network. In particular, multi-agent systems with a normal learning rate increased the throughput of associated user equipment by a whooping 212.5% compared to a macrocell-only scheme."

Choosing a correct and reliable marker would increase the chance of creating a more stable augmented object especially for visualizing a building structure. Unfortunately, most research on visualizing building structure uses a marker-based tracking approach where users must always bring a pre-printed paper as a tracking media. This creates a problem for every time users demonstrate a specific augmented structure object, they still need to bring a printed marker to show the augmented object. The purpose of this research is to investigate the applicability of markerless-based tracking as a solution whether it can substitute the marker-based tracking on augmented reality problems. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is used as a markerless tracking method where it tracked and mapped the surface environment using feature extraction, then set an anchor at the specified location where the augmented object visualization appears. The results of the research found that from a total of 30 object detection tests, 21 objects are successfully detected and 9 undetected objects, this shows that markerless-based tracking is applicable and can substitute marker-based tracking for a structural campus visualization.,"

Contextual information such as event occurrence, event time, and event location can be exposed to an adversary by just monitoring network packet transmission. This kind of information is very important because it can leak location information of key nodes or even detected events themselves. Therefore, proposing a contextual unobservability scheme is a challenging task in sensor networks considering many issues: the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, the different attacker models, the network resource constraints, and the overhead on system performance. Most of the existing location privacy schemes are not addressing all these issues and are either not efficient against global adversaries or degrade significantly network performance. Thus in this paper, we propose an efficient location contextual anonymity scheme for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) that exploits the cross-layer joint design among the application, routing, and MAC layers. Our proposed location unobservability scheme combines the source coding technique, probabilistic packet transmission, multipath routing, and priority-based dropping policy to enhance the efficiency level of the provided privacy service without noticeably affecting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement for delivering multimedia content in WMSN. Performance evaluation results show that our proposed privacy mechanism outperforms other proposed location privacy techniques in terms of privacy efficiency (safety period) and network performance (end-to-end delay and energy consumption)."

The most common limitations are sparsity and the cold-start problem. This article proposes two models to mitigate the effects of these limitations. The proposed models exploit five sources of information: rating information, which involves two sources, namely explicit and implicit, which can be extracted via users ratings, and two types of social relations: explicit and implicit relations, the last source is confidence values that are included in the first model only. The whole sources are combined into the Singular Value Decomposition plus (SVD++) method. First, to extract implicit relations, each non-friend pair of users, the Multi-Steps Resource Allocation (MSRA) method is adopted to compute the probability of being friends. If the probability has accepted value which exceeds a threshold, an implicit relationship will be created. Second, the similarity of explicit and implicit social relationships for each pair of users is computed. Regarding the first model, a confidence value between each pair of users is computed by dividing the number of common items by the total number of items which have also rated by the first user of this pair. The confidence values are combined with the similarity values to produce the weight factor. Furthermore, the weight factor, explicit, and implicit feedback information are integrated into the SVD++ method to compute the missing prediction values. Additionally, three standard datasets are utilized in this study, namely Last.Fm, Ciao, and FilmTrust, to evaluate our models. The experimental results have revealed that the proposed models outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy."
