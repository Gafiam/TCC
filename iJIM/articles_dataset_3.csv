			Real Time System Monitoring and Analysis-Based Internet of Things (IoT) Technology in Measuring Outdoor Air Quality
					",",											Air Quality, 											IoT, 											Web, 											Measuring, 											Internet of Things									,","2021-05-25,",,",					,,,					The presence of large peatland in Riau, Indonesia, could cause air pollution due to peatland fires which causes the presence of thick smoke every year in Riau,  dis-rupting human activities. In order to monitor the air quality, in this paper,  the main advantage of the  Internet of Things (IoT) is the ability to transfer data over the network without requiring human-to-human or human interaction to the com-puter   used. In this paper, we propose an air quality monitor that can display web-based information to show the temperature and air humidity, and detects CO, CO2 gases, and alcohol in real time with the help of DHT11 and MQ135 sensors, Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pie. The results show our proposed system can successfully show each parameter of the air quality on the website and make suggestions about the overall air quality level. With our proposed system, we hope the government can respond faster to mitigate the bad air quality level and give information to public about the air quality level in a faster and more accurate way.,,				,"

			Helping Junior High School Student to Learn Fibonacci Sequence with Video-Based Learning
					",",											Fibonacci, 											Junior High School student, 											Video Based Learning, 											Geometry Sequence									,","2021-06-04,",,",					,,,					In the 21st century, a teacher must be able to make teaching and learning activities conductive, fun That can improve students’ learning interest. Fibonacci sequence material is one of the materials that is difficult for Junior High school students to master. Based on this problem, the focus of this research is to create video learning on Fibonacci sequence material using Hawgent. This research is developed in Guangxi Normal University, China. This research is a research and development (RnD) using 4D model. 4D model consists of Defining, Design, Development, Dissemination. Video learning is made using interesting animations that are easy for students to understand. The results of this study indicate that the video learning has passed validation and can be sent to schools to help students understand Fibonacci sequence,,				,"

			Professional Skills Development Through the Network Learning Community Using an Online Learning Platform
					",",											Networked Learning Community, 											21st century learning, 											multimedia industry, 											live streaming media									,","2021-06-18,",,",					,,,					Networked learning Community (NLC)  that integrates a professional context into the learning experience that uses learning networks to promote self-efficacy and professional development. Online Learning design integrates three techniques: focus on developing personal learning networks, live streaming and online based learning communities and immersive skills and experience mastery for professionals. The hypothesis is that networked learning community among peers in the online learning will help support skills development and confidence in sustainable use of the platform in a personalized way. Meanwhile networking for learning with professionals will strengthen the impact of mastery experience on self-efficacy. Learning experiences as relevant for lifelong learning and professional success are important in today's learning era. NLC aligned with the goals of the 21st century skills movement can be an important mechanism for scaling up efforts to redesign academies that offer skills with a forum for broad but personal learning. The live streaming technique in the learning process in online media has a significant impact in monitoring and monitoring one-on-one learners' abilities. Learning outcomes can be easily corrected and evaluated by relevant experts so that the work can be used as a good portfolio. In the application of the  NLC the target output is that there is a promotion mechanism for students to the industrial world by bringing together professional companies and / or developing entrepreneurship with the addition of business training to the relevant NLC. The results of the platform development show that the flow and process of improving skills and professional learning with the community in one field of multimedia industry is getting better,,				,"

			The Impact of Teaching by Using STEM Approach in The Development of Creative Thinking and Mathematical Achievement Among the Students of The Fourth Scientific Class
					",",											STEM Introduction, 											Innovative Thinking, 											Mathematical Achievement									,","2021-07-13,","The research aims to know the impact of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education on both creative thinking and mathematical achievement. To achieve it, the two researchers followed the quasi-experimental approach with an experimental design for two groups, one experimental and the other a control. The research sample consisted of (32) female students from the fourth scientific grade in Al-Intisar Preparatory School for Girls / Al-Rasafa, First Directorate. The sample was chosen intentionally and was divided into two groups: a control group studying by the traditional method, their number (16), and an experimental group that applied the STEM approach, their number also (16). There was parity between the two research groups in the variables (chronological age, previous achievement in mathematics, innovative thinking). The research tools consist of testing innovative thinking skills (fluency, flexibility, originality, relationships) and achievement tests. The research experiment was applied before and after. To test the validity of the hypotheses, data were collected and then statistically analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The results of the research found that there were statistically significant differences in both the tests of innovative thinking and mathematical achievement in favor of the experimental group that studied according to the STEM approach, and in light of the results, the researchers recommended several recommendations and suggestions.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

			The Influence of Sports Activities on College Students' Social Adaptability
					",,"2021-07-28,","The cultivation of talents has always been the basis of the development of economy, science and technology and the overall strength of all countries. With the further deepening of China's reform and opening up, the rapid development of the market economy and the gradual improvement of the level of information technology, the education sector is paying more attention to the cultivation of talents in all walks of life in China. As for college students is about to walk into society, how to learned during college all kinds of professional knowledge and skills in the future life and work, how reasonable in the future workplace, properly handle interpersonal relationships, how to better integrate into social life, reflect their own value, and to raise their competitive strength, and observe the rules and regulations, laws and regulations, Have a good moral integrity, set up the correct world outlook, outlook on life, values. All these are closely related to the social adaptability of college students. Physical education is an important way to implement quality-oriented education and cultivate talents with all-round development, which was clearly pointed out in the Guidelines for Physical Education Course Teaching in National Colleges and Universities issued in 2002.In the given physical education teaching objectives also explains that the students are required to show good sports ethics and cooperative spirit as well as correctly deal with the relationship between competition and cooperation.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"
