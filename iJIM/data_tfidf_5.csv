77,this paper aims to explore the various problems associated with the technological pedagogical and psychological aspects of mobile learning and develop recommendations for its improvement  mobile learning becomes increasingly popular today this type of learning is relatively new it has recently gained popularity due to the pandemic restrictions in 2020 as mobile learning is being actively used educators students and other professionals begin to note its positive and negative sides  the study is based on the method of experiment as well as an online 11item questionnaire was conducted developed by authors with 110 teachers in russian universities russian state university named by an kosygina im sechenov first moscow state medical university and kuban state technological university  the practical significance and prospects for further research are based on the possibility of using the results in further study of the problem of the impact of mobile applications on specific indicators  it was found that given the great prevalence of mobile devices today there is every reason to implement mobile learning at universities however there are infrastructural problems that prevent the widespread use of this mode of delivery problems with the internet old gadgets that do not support 4g lack of technical support etc teachers also mention a set of problems associated with the quality of such training which are mainly related to pedagogical and psychological aspects of the process about 56 of university teachers say that students often behave irresponsibly during online classes they are inattentive tend to skip lessons and do not hand in the tasks which leads to a decline of knowledge and failing at tests and exams around 68 of teachers have difficulties adapting their teaching methods to a mobile learning environment   this study proposes structured recommendations to improve the quality of mobile learning by advancing technology skills adapting mobile learning to the needs of universities and raising the motivation of teachers and students  the results of the study can be used to analyze and compare the impact of mobile learning on society efficiency in various fields as well as mobile learning of students on future employment and life in societyin the future it will be important to conduct a comparative analysis of the impact of mobile learning on students and teachers to study the effectiveness of such learning in general,paper aims explore various problems associated technological pedagogical psychological aspects mobile learning

emphasis is to teach beginners the basic alphabets words and common conversation they might come across to achieve this goal the main effort of this project is based on three aspects designing and delivering tigrigna alphabets words and conversation lessons by integrating audio and picture for the words alphabets and common conversations by giving exercises for each the lessons and allowing the user to keep track of hisher profile the tool contains three modules like tutorial management module exercise module and user profile module each of the modules are contained different components and functionalities it also includes a scenariobased fulfilling activities associated of learners and it encourages users to speak listen and write in tigrigna through the mission tasks of the project this tool may increase learners motivation to continue their tigrigna learning besides mobile devices provide the opportunity to learn tigrigna outside the classroom and to interact directly with a genuine living environmentresultsthis project is viewed by the institution of tigrigina language and litrature addiss ababa university and they are interested on the tool i deployed on the actual

98,walking is one of the most common modes of terrestrial locomotion for humans walking is essential for humans to perform most kinds of daily activities when a person walks there is a pattern in it and it is known as gait gait analysis is used in sports and healthcare we can analyze this gait in different ways like using video captured by the surveillance cameras or depth image cameras in the lab environment it also can be recognized by wearable sensors eg accelerometer force sensors gyroscope flexible goniometer magneto resistive sensors electromagnetic tracking system force sensors and electromyography emg analysis through these sensors required a lab condition or users must wear these sensors for detecting abnormality in gait action of a human we need to incorporate the sensors separately we can know about ones health condition by abnormal human gait after detecting it understanding a regular gait vs abnormal gait may give insights to the health condition of the subject using the smart wearable technologies therefore in this paper we proposed a way to analyze abnormal human gait through smartphone sensors though smart devices like smartphones and smartwatches are used by most of the person nowadays so we can track down their gait using sensors of these intelligent wearable devices in this study we used twentythree  people to record their walking activities among them fourteen people have normal gait actions and nine people were facing difficulties with their walking due to their illness to do the stratification of the gait of the subjects we have adopted five machine learning algorithms with addition a deep learning algorithm the advantages of the traditional classification are analyzed and compared among themselves after rigorous performance
