A lot of facilities can be taken from these devices with sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope. Different physical activities such as walking, jogging, sitting, etc., can be important for analysis like health state prediction and duration of exercise by using those sensors based on artificial intelligence. In this paper, we have implemented machine learning and deep learning algorithms to detect and recognize eight activities namely, walking, jogging, standing, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, sitting-in-a-car and cycling; with a maximum of 99.3% accuracy. A few activities are almost similar in action, such as sitting and sitting-in-a-car, but difficult to distinguish; which makes it more challenging to predict tasks.

As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, several people have drawn parallels to influenza. While both viruses cause respiratory infections, they propagate in very different ways. This has a major impact on the public health measures that can be used to fight each virus. These viruses are pandemic-causing in the same way. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, and can present themselves in several ways, ranging from asymptomatic to severe and deadly. A proposal is presented in this paper that uses two algorithms to define and classify these pandemics, they are: The Back Propagation (BP) classification algorithm and the Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering algorithm. Two stages are implemented in the proposed system: in the first step, the FCM algorithm is used to find out the type of virus, and this algorithm is capable of handling ambiguous features of viruses. In the second step, a BP neural network is used as a classifier to detect the pandemic class. The proposed system was trained and tested using a well-known dataset (covid-19 vs influenza). Information Gain (IG) is used to optimize the related features that affect the classification process to improve speed and accuracy.  The proposed mobile application is developed to support users easily detecting the COVID-19 infection by inputting the medical tests as significant features to the proposed system. The proposed system's accuracy is up to (89%), the framework was created using the Matlab programming environment and an Android Studio for Mobil application designing.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

It started in Wuhan, China, and has since spread rapidly among people living in other countries. Hence, the World Health Organization has considered COVID-19 as a pandemic that threatens millions of people’s lives. Due to the high number of infected people, many hospitals have been facing critical issues in providing the required medical services. For instance, some clinical centers have been unable to provide one of the most important medical services, namely blood tests to determine whether an individual is infected with COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to present an alternative diagnosis option to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. In this paper, a proposed intelligent detection communication system (IDCS) is configured for distributed mobile clinical centers to control the pandemic. In addition, the intelligent system is integrated with the Zigbee communication protocol to build a mobile COVID-19 detection system. The proposed system was trained on X-ray COVID-19 lung images used to identify infected people. The Zigbee protocol and decision tree algorithm were used to design the IDCS.

For example, Digital Twin (DT) system predicts the future state of physical assets using live simulation and controls the current state through real-time feedback. These systems rely on the ability to process big data stream to provide real-time responses. For, example it is estimated that one autonomous vehicle (AV) could produce 30 terabytes of data per day. AV will not be on the road before using an effective way to managing its big data and solve latency challenges. Cloud computing failed in the latency challenge, while Fog computing addresses it by moving parts of the computations from the Cloud to the edge of the network near the asset to reduce the latency. This work studies the challenges in data stream processing for DT in a fog environment. The challenges include fog architecture, the necessity of loosely-coupling design, the used virtual machine versus container, the stateful versus stateless operations, the stream processing tools, and live migration between fog nodes.

So, these problems are overcome by using chaotic maps in cryptography, which provide confusion and diffusion by providing uncorrelated numbers and randomness. Various works have been applied in the field of 3D content-encryption based on the chaotic system. This survey will attempt to review the approaches and aspects of the structure used for 3D content encryption methods for different papers.

Still, numerous barriers exist while developing and implementing such kind of learning analytics applications. Machine learning algorithms emerge as useful tools to endorse learning analytics by building models capable of forecasting the final outcome of students based on their available attributes. The machine learning algorithm’s performance demotes with using the entire attributes and thus a vigilant selection of predicting attributes boosts the performance of the produced model. Though, several constructive techniques facilitate to identify the subset of productive attributes, however, the challenging task is to evaluate if the prediction attributes are meaningful, explicit, and controllable by the students. This paper reviews the existing literature to come up with the student’s attributes used in developing prediction models. We propose a conceptual framework which demonstrates the classification of attributes as either latent or dynamic. The latent attributes may appear significant but the student is not able to control these attribute, on the other hand, the student has command to restrain the dynamic attributes. Each of the major class is further categorized to present an opportunity to the researchers to pick constructive attributes for model development.,,				,"

Therefore, the energy consumption and efficiency of these nodes are crucial factors that can influence the lifetime of the network. However, there is no coherent experimental based research which identifies the factors that influence the LoRa energy efficiency at various nodes density. In this paper, results on measuring the packet delivery ratio, packet loss, data rate and energy consumption ratio ECR to gauge the energy efficiency of LoRa devices at various nodes density are presented. It is shown that the ECR of LoRa is inversely proportional to the nodes density and that the ECR of the network is smaller at higher traffic indicating better network energy efficiency. It is also demonstrated that at high node density, spreading factor SF of 7 and 9 can improve the energy efficiency of the network by 5 and 3 times, respectively, compare to SF 11.,,				,"

Therefore, proper understanding of the pertinent issues about IoV implementation that can improve the VNs performance are essential. DSRC and cellular networks are considered as potential alternatives for endorsing V2X communications. DSRC is employed for intelligent and automotive transportation applications through short-range data exchange between DSRC-components. Although spectrum assigned to DSRC alone will not be appropriate to satisfy huge information traffic needs for internet access in vehicles. Cellular networks offer potential solutions, attributing extensive range of cell coverage, broadly deployed infrastructure and greater capacity. Nevertheless, centralized characteristics of these networks limit the ability to handle low-latency communications that can challenge the efficacy of several safety applications.

People usually create their own profiles and join communities to discuss different common issues that they have interest in. On the other hand, companies also can create their virtual presence on the social media networks to benefit from this media to understand the customers and gather richer information about them. With all of the benefits and advantages of social media networks, they should not always be seen as a safe place for communicating, sharing information and ideas, and establishing virtual communities. These information and ideas could carry with them hatred speeches that must be detected to avoid raising violence. Therefore, web content mining can be used to handle this issue. Web content mining is gaining more concern because of its importance for many businesses and institutions.  Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an important sub-area of web content mining.  The purpose of SA is to determine the overall sentiment attitude of writer towards a specific entity and classify these opinions automatically. There are two main approaches to build systems of sentiment analysis: the machine learning approach and the lexicon-based approach. This research presents the design and implementation for violence detection over social media using machine learning approach. Our system works on Jordanian Arabic dialect instead of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The data was collected from two popular social media websites (Facebook, Twitter) and has used native speakers to annotate the data. Moreover, different preprocessing techniques have been used to show their effect on our model accuracy. The Arabic lexicon was used for generating feature vectors and separate them to features set. Here, we have three well known machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Building on this view, Information Science Research Institute’s (ISRI) stemming and stop word file as a result of preprocessing were used to extract the features.

The practice inefficient and ineffective for university’s student attendance recording due to,  i) lecturer may lose the attendance sheet, ii) student may sign for their friends, iii) student may forget to sign on the attendance sheet, and iv) challenging to monitor attendance rate and analysis. Thus, there is a necessity to change these traditional attendance recording methods to a more efficient one. The attendance rate is significant because students are more likely to succeed in academics when they attend classes consistently. As such, a mobile app, namely Smart-Hadir, is designed to overcome problems as mentioned above. Smart-Hadir is a smartphone application developed by UMS aimed to record student attendance digitally during a class session. The technology used is slightly different from the existing applications, where Smart-Hadir is not using RFID technology but rather covers NFC, QR code, and beacon technologies. Attendance could be taken either using NFC or QR code displayed on the wall using a projector or scan the available beacon. Lecturers can create class session using the Smart-Hadir anywhere and anytime. Students are then required to take their attendance either scan the QR code, search the beacon, or swiped their student card on the lecturer’s phone. The students’ attendance will be immediately captured and saved into the database. Lecturers will be able to view the statistic report, identify and e-mail absentees, as well as monitor students’ attendance behaviour. A statistical report can be generated. It shows the percentages of students’ attendance rate, absent rate, and status. The Smart-Hadir is advantageous as it can be used to capture meeting or event attendance record as well.,,				,"

			‘Power-as-a-Service’ – A Hierarchical On-Demand Charging Model for Recharging the Mobile Nodes of MANETs
					",",											Cloud-oriented approach, 											connectivity, 											Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, 											network lifetime, 											operational efficiency, 											Power-as-a-Service									,","2021-06-18,",,",					,,,					Battery energy is a crucial issue that limits battery-powered mobile devices’ operational efficiency in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). Failure of a node affects both the lifetime and connectivity of a MANET, which has to initiate finding a new route from source to destination. This initiation causes more energy consumption in nodes. Failure of a node also causes network partitions, thereby resulting in sparse networks being formed. Existing energy-efficient strategies only defer the end of a node’s battery lifetime; they could not guarantee the MANET’s nonstop functioning. To address the issues caused by battery depletion, this paper proposes a “Cloud” oriented approach called Power-as-a-Service (PaaS), a hierarchical on-demand charging model for recharging the mobile nodes of the MANET. In PaaS, the MANET is alienated into non-overlapping disjoint zones, and for each zone, one Zone Charging Cloud Node (ZccN) is deployed to recharge the mobile nodes of that particular zone wirelessly. A High-power Charging Cloud Node (HccN) is deployed to wirelessly recharge the ZccNs in the MANET for the entire network. In PaaS, the ZccN recharges both the selected node for recharge and other nodes around the selected node that requested recharge and has higher power transfer efficiency. This strategy of PaaS improves the charging efficiency of cloud chargers by minimizing the urgent charging requests in the future, and thus the operational efficiency of the MANET improves. Extensive simulations indicate that the proposed PaaS model with a hierarchy of cloud chargers improves the operational efficiency of MANETs in terms of reducing the death rate of mobile nodes, thereby improving the lifetime and connectivity probability of MANETs.,,				,"

Network densification through the addition of low power nodes (picocell) to conventional high power nodes addresses the bandwidth dearth issue, but unfortunately introduces unwanted interference into the network which causes a reduction in throughput. This paper developed a reinforcement learning model that assisted in coordinating interference in a heterogeneous network comprising macro-cell and pico-cell base stations. The learning mechanism was derived based on Q-learning, which consisted of agent, state, action, and reward. The base station was modeled as the agent, while the state represented the condition of the user equipment in terms of Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio. The action was represented by the transmission power level and the reward was given in terms of throughput. Simulation results showed that the proposed Q-learning scheme improved the performances of average user equipment throughput in the network. In particular, multi-agent systems with a normal learning rate increased the throughput of associated user equipment by a whooping 212.5% compared to a macrocell-only scheme.,,				,"

			Mobile Augmented Reality for Campus Visualization Using Markerless Tracking in an Indonesian Private University
					",",											Augmented Reality, 											Structure Visualization, 											Markerless Tracking									,","2021-06-04,","Marker in augmented reality plays a major part to initiate a virtual object in an augmented environment. Choosing a correct and reliable marker would increase the chance of creating a more stable augmented object especially for visualizing a building structure. Unfortunately, most research on visualizing building structure uses a marker-based tracking approach where users must always bring a pre-printed paper as a tracking media. This creates a problem for every time users demonstrate a specific augmented structure object, they still need to bring a printed marker to show the augmented object. The purpose of this research is to investigate the applicability of markerless-based tracking as a solution whether it can substitute the marker-based tracking on augmented reality problems. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is used as a markerless tracking method where it tracked and mapped the surface environment using feature extraction, then set an anchor at the specified location where the augmented object visualization appears. The results of the research found that from a total of 30 object detection tests, 21 objects are successfully detected and 9 undetected objects, this shows that markerless-based tracking is applicable and can substitute marker-based tracking for a structural campus visualization.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

This condition is most challenging to detect in this group because they tend to think about other people's negative assumptions. Adolescents with depressive symptoms refuse to seek professional help due to their stigma and their future if they were labeled as depressed teenagers. Depression is a severe mental issue that should be detected from an early stage so that the problem can be curbed and resolved immediately. Diagnosis should be carried out to assess mental health, followed by referral to professional help. This study aims to motivate adolescents to diagnose depression levels through gamification techniques. Fifty-three secondary students participated in a survey designed in this study to measure motivation enhancement factors. The result of this study was used to develop a depression diagnosis model. The proposed model applied a gamification design technique consisting of three main ideas: gamification elements, user types, and motivational elements. This model will serve as the foundation to develop a mobile application system that can benefit users, especially adolescents, in self-diagnosing depression.,,				,"

Companies developing apps face increasing challenges such as short time to market or demand for high quality. Furthermore, the success of an app also depends on how users perceive its quality. Feedback provided by users influences other potential users and provides new opportunities for identifying features. Consequently, it is a valuable source of input for app developers with respect to product improvements. One form is textual feedback. This kind of feedback is usually distributed across various data sources. Therefore, it must be captured from these sources and put into one single pool of data before it can be analyzed. The analysis must take into account the peculiarities of the short release cycles and high change rate of features for mobile apps. In this article, we present User Echo Service (UES), which was built to address heterogeneous data sources.  The aim of UES is to allow product managers to be able to be always up to date with the latest feedback data.

The taxi industry has undergone tremendous changes with the existent of e-hailing service in the industry. Due to the introduction of mobile applications, e-hailing service takes part to compete in the market. The government has given priority to overcome the problem by introducing travel demand strategies that focus on mitigating the demand competition between the taxi and e-hailing services. One of the strategies is the adoption of a mobile application in taxi service. This paper aims to develop a system dynamics model to analyse mobile application adoption’s impact on customers’ demand on the mode share of taxi and e-hailing services as a measured output. System dynamics is a decision-experimentation method that creates a learning environment in which policymakers gain a better understanding of how the system will respond to their decisions and the potential unintended consequences of decisions. With the developed SD model, the feedback relations between mobile application adoptions on the output of taxi demand can be observed. Furthermore, the demand competition between the taxi and e-hailing services can be minimised using this SD model. The result shows that, by implementing the usage of the mobile application in taxi services, more users will be attracted to use the taxi service. With that service option, users will shift their attraction from e-hailing to taxi service, which is then able to minimise the demand competition. This research can benefit policymakers and authorities in the department of transportation to serve as a planning tool so that the demand of taxi and e-hailing services in Malaysia with the adoption of mobile application in taxi service can be predicted.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

Contextual information such as event occurrence, event time, and event location can be exposed to an adversary by just monitoring network packet transmission. This kind of information is very important because it can leak location information of key nodes or even detected events themselves. Therefore, proposing a contextual unobservability scheme is a challenging task in sensor networks considering many issues: the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, the different attacker models, the network resource constraints, and the overhead on system performance. Most of the existing location privacy schemes are not addressing all these issues and are either not efficient against global adversaries or degrade significantly network performance. Thus in this paper, we propose an efficient location contextual anonymity scheme for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) that exploits the cross-layer joint design among the application, routing, and MAC layers. Our proposed location unobservability scheme combines the source coding technique, probabilistic packet transmission, multipath routing, and priority-based dropping policy to enhance the efficiency level of the provided privacy service without noticeably affecting the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement for delivering multimedia content in WMSN. Performance evaluation results show that our proposed privacy mechanism outperforms other proposed location privacy techniques in terms of privacy efficiency (safety period) and network performance (end-to-end delay and energy consumption).,,				,"

This research aims to propose a learning process model of flipped classroom to develop research skill by applying critical inquiry theory in the instructional design to develop thinking, finding answer and research skills which are the key competency for conducting a research. The research methodology was divided into two phases: the first phase included literature review to develop the learning process model, the second phase included learning model suitability evaluation by expert. The results showed that experts have strongly agreed with the learning model. We anticipate that our flipped classroom model which has divided into 3 phase included ,, pre-class, in-class and after-class phases with the addition of thinking skill development activity by using critical inquiry technics could be used for reference for teachers on planning and implementing instructional activities to enhance the research skill of undergraduate students,,				,"

			A High-Performance Routing Protocol Based on Mobile Agent for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
					",",											High-Performance, 											Routing Protocol, 											IWCETT, 											MANETs									,","2021-02-12,",,",					,,,					This paper presents a modification of a well-known routing protocol, namely Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector, as a solution to improve the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. We adapted the mobile agent technology as to novel metrics for routing in those networks. The metric is a function of the loss rate, the bandwidth and the end-to-end delay of the link. Indeed, we established a new tunable parameter to obtain a tradeoff between throughput and delay when computing the new metric. As a result, any routing protocol using this metric can al-ways choose a high-throughput and low-delay path between a source and a destination. Hence, the achievable performance of the mobile ad hoc networks has been improved remarkably with our modified routing protocol,,,				,"

					",",											Image format, 											Text-only network, 											Free basics service, 											Digital Divide									,","2021-02-12,","The number of devices connected to the Internet using mobile devices is increasing every day. Charge for mobile data over 3G and 4G networks is high in some countries which pushes users to browse the Internet through text-only service. Facebook proposed free basics service which allows users to browse Facebook for free but without showing images. This research formats the images on web pages in a method that makes images transferred over text-only networks. This allows users with low income or slow connections to surf text service over the internet with images supported. The main objective is to test the free basic service by Facebook and Internet Service Provider over 3G networks additionally proposing an image format for text-only networks. The proposed algorithm converts .png and .jpg images and post them on the Facebook page. The results from the Facebook page show images can be seen over 3G networks with free mode enabled.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"
