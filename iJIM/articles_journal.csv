			An Effectual Secured Approach Against Sybil Attacks in Wireless Networks
					",",											Network Security, Wireless Network Security, Security in Wireless Environment									,","2022-05-10,","In both wireless and mobile ad hoc networks, assaults can come from a variety of different sources. The terms ""active attack"" and ""passive attack"" describe these two types of attacks. In the network community, the Sybil attack is one of the most often used and deployed techniques for sniffing identities and repurposing them. Multiple identities or Sybil attacks have recently sparked a lot of interest in the research community. The algorithms and networks on which they are tested are vastly different among the many methods that have been offered. Since researchers can't evaluate these systems side by side or test their efficacy on real-world social networks with a variety of structural features, it's difficult to say whether there are any other (perhaps more efficient) methods of Sybil protection. In the event of a Sybil attack, the gatecrasher subverts the system framework's notoriety arrangement by creating a large number of pseudonymous individuals and then using them to add an enormously imbalanced influence. Three factors determine a notoriety framework's susceptibility to a Sybil attack: how quickly personalities can be generated, how much the notoriety framework accepts inputs from substances that lack a chain of trust, and if the notoriety framework handles all components equally. A large-scale Sybil ambush in Bittorrent Mainline may be accomplished in a cheap and effective manner, according to confirmation. A substance on a distributed system is a piece of software that has access to the resources of the local community. By displaying a character, a distributed system element reveals itself to the world. A single chemical can have an impact on more than one character. Numerous characters can be assigned to a single element. The personalities of substances in shared systems are used for the objectives of repetition, asset transfer, reliability, and trustworthiness, among other reasons. For remote elements to be aware of characters without necessarily being aware of the personality-to-neighborhood correlation, distributed systems make use of the character as a decision. Each different identification is normally considered to be associated with a separate local entity by convention. A single local entity may have several identities in actuality. In order to avoid and identify Sybil assaults, an empirical technique is used in this study. According to the base paper, any nodes with RSS greater than the provided threshold are regarded to be attackers under the present approach. A centralized way to monitor the mobile nodes is required to prevent this assault. As the server agent assumes full control of the ad-hoc network, malevolent nodes or selfish nodes are fully eliminated from the system.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

			Designing an Android-Based Peer Assessment E-Rubric
					",",											e-rubrics, 											android-based assessment, 											online teaching, 											peer assessment									,","2022-05-10,","Previous research has shown that peer assessment has beneficial effects on students’ learning. Inspired by the need of students to involve peer assessment for gaining some constructive feedback for their works, such as in translation and writing courses, we developed an android-based e-rubric. Android was favored as the assessment platform due to its customizability and affordability. Two classes of English Department with 54 students participated in this research. Interviews and focus-group discussions were conducted to obtain data for needs analysis and collect users’ feedback, whereas the online survey was done to measure the students’ satisfaction. The e-rubric was developed through eight stages: (1) needs analysis, (2) development of rubrics, (3) expert validation, (4) creating the e-rubric app, (5) implementation, (6) users’ feedback, (7) product refinement, and (8) survey of users’ satisfaction. The results show that the developed e-rubric app is useful for supporting collaborative works among students as it allows them to assess each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, the android platform gives them a handy-and-engaging experience for completing the assessment. In this paper, we review relevant literature justifying the development of the app, outline the formulation steps, and explain how the app can be used in the classroom. Taking the limitations of the app development into account, we propose some recommendations for future research.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

			A New Classification Method for Drone-Based Crops in Smart Farming
					",",											Crop classification, drone, transfer learning, smart farming									,","2022-05-10,","During the past decades, smart farming became one of the most important revolutions in the agriculture industry. Smart farming makes use of different communication technologies and modern information sciences for increasing the quality and quantity of the product. On the other hand, drones showed a major potential for enhancing imagery systems and remote sensing usage for many different applications such as crop classification, crop health monitoring, and weed management. In this paper, an intelligent method for classifying crops is proposed to use a transfer learning approach based on a number of drone images. Moreover, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method is used as a classifier to improve efficiency for obtaining more accurate results in the training and testing phases. Various metrics are measured to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model such as accuracy rate of detection, error rate and confusing matrix. It is found to be proven from the experimental results that the proposed method presents more efficient results with an accuracy detection rate of 92.93%.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

					",",											attitude, 											brand, 											trust, 											behaviour intention, 											digital marketing									,","2022-05-10,",,",					,,,					Events are crucial to the industry's growth and economic benefits. Nearly 1.5 billion people visit corporate events each year across the world. Even though the event was formerly regarded as the industry's fastest-growing segment, it is currently undergoing a significant transformation and shift because of the COVID-19 epidemic. Businesses are embracing digital marketing to communicate with their customers during this pandemic catastrophe. As a result, the pandemic has an impact on core ideas and marketing innovations. The objective of the research is to look at the effects of digital marketing in the event industry in Malaysia and the United States (USA) during covid-19. Samples of the study were consumers who attended virtual events in Malaysia and the United States (USA) for a period of two years following the pandemic Covid-19 from 2019 to 2021. This study used a survey questionnaire to obtain the primary data. The finding of the study showed that digital marketing has an influence on customer attitude, brand awareness, trust, and intention among the event attendees from Malaysia and United States. Finding further showed that brand awareness had minimal influence on the purchasing intention of event attendees from Malaysia and the United States (USA). Malaysian participants believe trust is the most important factor in developing an intention to join the event, whereas Americans believe that customer attitude is the most crucial aspect of developing an intention. This study recommends event planners develop digital marketing that keeps up with new technological innovations and changing customer expectations in terms of content that should be more tailored as well as wow-factor-filled attendee experience.,,				,"

			Assessing the Impact of Mobile-Based Training on Teachers’ Achievement and Usage Attitude
					",",											CPD, 											Mobile learning attitude, 											Academic achievement, 											Professional Development, 											ICT, 											Teachers Training, 											Mobile Based Training									,","2022-05-10,","Teachers' professional development plays a key role in imparting quality education. However, the design and delivery of quality professional development programs is a challenging problem due to numerous issues such as inadequate policies, lack of skilled personnel and training, politically influenced appointments, and dependency on the traditional modes of training. The COVID-19 pandemic has further escalated the situation and severely affected trainers’ and trainees' interest, motivation, and engagement. Due to its ubiquitous, flexible, and cost-effective nature, technology has played a key role in carrying out educational activities even in the pandemic situation. However, little emphasis has been provided on the use of technology for the professional development of teachers. This study investigates the effects of mobile-based training app on teachers learning outcomes and attitudes towards its usage. The training app is based on our enhanced CPD model for teachers' professional development. For the study, 308 in-service elementary school teachers of division shaheed Benazirabad are selected for the training and assessment purposes. To perform the experiments, teachers were divided into two groups: experimental and control. The experimental group contained 158 teachers which were provided training through the mobile app. The remaining 150 teachers of the control group were provided training using the traditional physical appearance. Pre and post-test were designed to examine the effects of mobile-based training on the teachers’ learning outcomes before and after the training intervention. Besides assessing the learning outcomes, the attitude towards the use of the training app was also assessed using the attitude scale. The analysis of results determined that the training through a mobile app has a significant effect on teachers learning outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Furthermore, teachers showed a positive attitude towards the use of training app. The experimental group had significantly high attitude scores in post-test toward mobile-based training systems. Teachers’ experience using the mobile app has been perceived as an approach that has significantly increased teaching proficiency. Experimental results suggest that mobile-based professional development modes positively impact teachers' professional and academic achievement and performance to produce a rising number of certified teachers irrespective of time, space, and financial constraints.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

			Fuzzy Logic-Based Evaluation Model of Handwritten Font Sizes Readability on Extra Small Devices
					",",											artificial intelligence, responsive web, mobile pohones, letter cut, variable font									,","2022-05-10,","Handwritten fonts are appealing to designers, but their application in web design can cause a readability problems. Different handwritten letter cuts in different font sizes are not equally readable on all screen types. The problem often occurs on extra small devices such as mobile phones. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the combination of the font type and appropriate font size that will ensure responsiveness and be readable on different devices, especially the small ones. For this purpose, a study of readability of monoline handwritten font in seven letter cuts (thin, ultra-light, light, regular, semi-bold, bold, and ultra-bold) in several font sizes was conducted. Variable font was used because it contains all style versions of one typeface family, as opposed to standard font families that use different files for each style version. Also, variable font is suitable for use on web because one file with all the necessary typeface styles is significantly smaller in size than classic families with multiple files which shortens the font loading time. Furthermore, model of readability evaluation using the fuzzy logic based postprocessing method for segmentation values related to evaluation criteria is proposed. Prototype of a variable handwritten fonts are tested in responsive web environment, using CSS technology. The results show that handwritten font size readability evaluation has measurable output because the score combine various numeral factors affecting the readability of particular font size in several letter cuts.  Using of proposed model in short time can show readability level of some font type in some font size on a new responsive web suitable for different screen sizes, including extra small devices.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

					",",											action level, 											car driver, 											finger gesture, 											gestural interactions, 											motivation level, 											smartphone user interface									,","2022-05-10,","Mobile phones that accept input by a user’s finger motion are becoming increasingly common. However, they still have challenging problems to research, such as the ergonomic and safety aspects. As an outcome, more research required its capabilities and a critical examination of the existing gestural interfaces and how they assist drivers' activities while driving. This research paper attempts to present a comprehensive understanding of possible gestures on the smartphones by conducting user testing with a sample data of 30 drivers from three different age groups. The user testing was performed in an actual driving environment. Observation and interviews were carried out to study drivers’ behavior while driving. The data gathered were then interpreted into action and motivation levels. The action level was defined by how drivers interact with smartphones while driving, and in motivation level, a study on why drivers interact in that manner was conducted. The results were then drawn to a table with the task carried out during user testing. In conclusion, this research aims to consider all these issues that drivers confront while driving. This is to determine how a more advanced gestural interaction of smartphone interfaces may be created to meet drivers' safety and ergonomic concerns.,",",					,,,					,,,				,"

			A Social Virtual Reality Mobile Application for Learning and Practicing English
					",",											Virtual Reality, 											Mobile Learning, 											Social Networking, 											English Language Learning, 											Educational Technologies, 											Saudi Arabia, 											Covid-19, 																				,","2022-05-10,",,",					,,,					Many studies promise that virtual reality (VR) applications will be one of the most used tools in foreign language learning. This is because VR keeps learners engaged, motivated, and prepared with better communication skills due to the simulation of real-life environments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing, it became difficult to use and practice newly learned language skills with real people directly. This paper proposes a social VR mobile application that can be used anytime anywhere to offer a set of different VR environments that simulate real-life situations in order to learn and practice the English language. The application aims to improve speaking skills by offering a private session with a native speaker tutor or a community of learners to practice speaking. It combines the benefits of mobile learning, social networks, and VR. Initial usability testing results showed that the application is simple and easy to use, with some problems discovered and resolved. The application demonstrates that applying VR tools could contribute positively to learning English among the language learners using it.,,				,"
